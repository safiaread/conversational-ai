"1","Flo-Rida","Jump","[Chorus: Nelly Furtado]  
When I say jump, you say how high  
I ain't never seen nobody, how they get so high  
Like a bird, like a plane, this party got me insane  
This party got me insane, so jump jump jump jump  
  
[Flo Rida]  
Now I'm gon take it to the roof  
Everybody with me got they own parachute  
You ain't scared of heights when you sipping on Goose  
Party all night like I'm flying jet new?  
You ain't never seen nobody get this loose  
Shawty acting naughty with her body, what it do  
Jump to this man, bump to this man  
Stomp to this man, crunk to this man  
Got another hit man  
Hold up, I wanna go up, don't wanna throw up  
My clique pour up, and every bad chick know us  
Dance, the boy got us all feeling high  
Ask, the shawty, I'm a astronaut  
High rollin baby like I'm jumping on fire  
Super Bowl pimp good Year on tire  
Can I be a bird, I gotta be fly  
Butterfly and spur, and I got a couple words  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
[Flo Rida]  
When I run up in the club, jump in, then I gotta be there  
Check it out, shawty like Nike Air  
Up up and away take it off like mere?  
NBA balling, I don't care  
Now what do you do when you see you a shawty and she make it bounce in the
room?  
Hey girl, come on baby, you a fine sexy lady, can I get on your hot air
balloon?  
Sky high, still clubbing like I'm part of the mile high  
Ears popping, Bubbalicious help me get right  
Keep popping in position after midnight  
Moese? fried chicken up in NY  
Jigga what, don't it feel good  
Houston? We gonna jump ship, all aboard  
Come around me, and we'll parlay, we're throwed?  
Cali is jumping, hit the switch on the 6 4  
  
[Chorus]  
  
[Flo Rida]  
Come on and jump, jump, jump [Repeat: x3]  
(All my ladies) get down, get down, get down  
(All my ladies) get down, get down, get down  
(All the fellas) jump, jump, jump, jump, jump, jump  
(All the fellas, the ladies, the fellas, the ladies, let me see you)  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
Get down, get down, get down  
Get down, get down, get down

Though they're disapprovin',  
Keep them dogies movin', rawhide.  
Don't try to understand 'em,  
Just rope 'em, throw, and brand 'em.  
Soon we'll be livin' high and wide.  
My heart's calculatin',  
My true love will be waitin',  
Be waitin' at the end of my ride.  
  
Move 'em on, head 'em up,  
Head 'em up, move 'em on,

Head 'em out, ride 'em in,  
Ride 'em in, let 'em out,  
Cut 'em out, ride 'em in, rawhide!  
  
The ending lyrics are:  
  
Keep rollin', rollin', rollin',  
Though the streams are swollen,  
Keep them dogies rollin', rawhide.  
Through rain and wind and weather,  
Hell bent for leather,  
Wishin' my gal was by my side.  
All the things I'm missin',  
Good vittles, love and kissin',  
Are waiting at the end of my ride.  
  
Move 'em on, head 'em up,  
Head 'em up, move 'em on,  
Move 'em on, head 'em up, rawhide!

"4","Louis Armstrong","Between The Devil And The Deep Blue Sea","I don't want you  
But I hate to lose you  
You've got me in between  
The devil and the deep blue sea  
  
I forgive you  
'Cause I can't forget you  
You've got me in between  
The devil and the deep blue sea  
  
I ought to cross you off my list  
But when you come knockin' at my door  
Fate seems to give my heart a twist  
And I come running back for more  
  
I should hate you  
But, mama, I guess instead I love you  
You've got me in between  
The devil and the deep blue sea

"5","Gary Numan","Innocence Bleeding","Do you believe in Heaven?  
That man's soul is eternal?  
Our prayers are always answered?  
And miracles can happen?  
  
Save me.  
  
But don't you wonder?  
The Holy Ghost and Jesus?  
In paradise and angels?  
That God is all forgiving?  
  
Save me.  
  
Reward the faithful?  
He lies to you and deceives.  
A dark salvation comes.  
Innocence bleeding.  
  
Too dark to see the pictures of Heaven  
Too dark to find the Garden of Eden.  
Blinded by faith and stories of wonder,  
Devine mercy? Mercy lies bleeding.  
  
Save me.

"6","Christmas Songs","Jolly Old St. Nicholas","Jolly old St. Nicholas  
Lean your ear this way  
Don't you tell a single soul  
What I'm going to say  
  
Christmas Eve is coming soon  
Now, you dear old man  
Whisper what you'll bring to me  
Tell me if you can  
  
When the clock is striking twelve  
When I'm fast asleep  
Down the chimney broad and black  
With your pack you'll creep  
  
All the stockings you will find  
Hanging in a row  
Mine will be the shortest one  
You'll be sure to know  
  
Johnny wants a pair of skates  
Suzie wants a sled  
Nellie wants a picture book  
Yellow, Blue, and Red  
  
As for me, my little brain  
Isn't very bright  
Choose for me, old Santa Claus  
What you think is right

And you know that I feel the same

And all that we share is the blame.  
  
Let's take a chance while there's something to say  
Oh darling, don't throw it away  
We know that we've both got so much to lose  
And the rest of our lifetime to pay  
  
We could be good to each other (Yes, we could)  
Better than we've ever been  
Oh, darlin' we're starting all over  
It's all over, all over again

"8","Kelly Clarkson","My Grown Up Christmas List","Do you remember me  
I sat upon your knee  
I wrote to you with childhood fantasies  
Well I'm all grown up now  
And still need help somehow  
I'm not a child but my heart still can dream  
  
So here's my lifelong wish  
My grown up Christmas list  
Not for myself but for a world in need  
No more lives torn apart  
That wars would never start  
And time would heal all hearts  
And everyone would have a friend  
And right would always win  
And love would never end, no  
This is my grown up Christmas list  
  
As children we believe  
The grandest sight to see  
Was something lovely wrapped beneath the tree  
But Heaven only knows  
That packages and bows  
Can never heal a heartached human soul  
  
No more lives torn apart  
That wars would never start  
And time would heal all hearts  
And everyone would have a friend  
And right would always win  
And love would never end, no  
This is my grown up Christmas list  
  
What is this illusion called the innocence of youth  
Maybe only in our blind belief can we ever find the truth  
  
No more lives torn apart  
That wars would never start  
And time would heal all hearts  
And everyone would have a friend  
And right would always win  
And love would never end, no  
This is my grown up Christmas list  
This is my only lifelong wish  
This is my grown up Christmas list

"9","Pogues","Mother Mo Chroi","It was 1962 and I was  
Two years out of school  
When I got on board a boat  
That was bound for Liverpool  
The day we sailed away  
I remember it so well  
Took one look at the North Wall  
And bid a fond farewell  
  
It's a hard thing to leave the land  
Of your childhood  
Touched by the rivers  
And kissed by the sea  
The places you played  
With your childhood companions  
To leave dear old Ireland and  
Mother Mo Chroi  
  
Though I'm going far away  
And I may never return here  
There is always one thing  
That I'll keep within me  
Deep in my heart a furious devotion  
The love of old Ireland  
And Mother Mo Chroi  
  
At the top of Pentonville Road  
I saw the sun setting  
The town laid out before me  
Looked beautiful to me  
Away from all the sighing  
The suffering and dying  
I dreamed of the future  
The young and the free  
  
But the years they go by quickly  
Now I know I can't remain here  
Where each day brings me closer  
To that final misery  
My kids will never scrape shit round here  
And I won't die crying in a pint of beer  
I'm going back to Ireland  
And my Mother Mo Chroi

'Hi, guys, are you in a band or something?  
I mean it would be so cool  
If you were in a band 'cause you're  
Driving a big bus with band on the front of it'  
'Why don't you shut up and get on board will ya?'  
'Wow! I have it here you got a stereo and a microwave  
And, and you got a beer,  
I'd like a Heineken if you've got one'  
That's real cool, that's great, yeah!'  
'Would you like to see Black Bart?'  
'Who's Black Bart?'  
'Let me introduce you'  
  
Black Bart's seen it  
Black Bart knows  
Black Bart's done it  
The Black Bart blues  
Suspended in suspension  
Medieval nights in Tennessee, and elsewhere  
We all got to try the Black Bart blues  
  
Black Bart's truckin' ain't what it seems  
Black Bart's lookin'  
Don't know where she's been  
Maybe she's an acrobat  
Spends her evenings dancing on a pole  
We all got to try the Black Bart blues  
  
Black Bart tried most anything  
Black Bart liked it but he couldn't sing  
So he asked me to tell ya  
Try it for yourself and you will see  
We all got to try the Black Bart blues  
  
'What did you do that for?'  
'I'm sorry, I just, I guess I'm not used to...  
'Shut up and get on with it will you'  
  
Black Bart's livin' across the ocean now  
Black Bart's lookin' to come back somehow  
So if you are a dancer,  
You could dance his pole in May  
That's a maypole  
  
Black Bart's coming  
Now Black Bart's gone  
Black Bart did it so I wrote this song  
Whatever and however,  
In and out or several at a time mmm yes!  
We all got to do the Black Bart blues  
Here comes the guitar solo  
  
We all got to try the Black Bart blues  
Yowsa! Yowsa! Yowsa!

There's a mockingbird that's flown again

I love you more every day, babe  
Though I aggravate you

And tonight, we'll fight  
Again

In the tinted snow  
And let the coast emotions

Will make the mount to ghost town  
Slow down! To the planet scope  
And if you promised to turn up  
  
You're just not here anymore  
And let the spectators abolish  
Until the buildings form beyond  
You only need us to be us  
  
And make the best of downtown

Let the records score

"15","Diana Ross","Experience","See me loving you  
A fool without a lover  
How can that possibly be  
Maybe you can show me why  
I shiver when you're closer  
I remember your touch without it  
Let me drown in your ecstasy  
It's got to be do or die  
  
Don't tell me love is just one night  
I know it's not true  
There should be someone there to catch you  
When the rain falls  
And you can turn away my heaven  
And maybe I was wrong  
I depended on the inner voice of  
  
Experience, or just imagination  
Whatever you believe in, you can lose  
And one way or the other, we can find  
Another world we can run away to  
I'm living for the  
Experience, is only what you make it  
You live forever but you never know  
That somebody loves you  
And when the sky is open  
Fly away lovers can share  
I'll be there  
  
And you can make the earth move  
You can take me with no struggle  
Lead me through your mystical dreams  
Show me what you are  
And we can make the wind blow  
You're the power and I'm in it  
You can be the fire I start  
I want your heart  
  
And let there be a story when the stories are told  
I need to hear you say you love me when the night falls  
We may never go to heaven but one thing that is sure  
You can not ignore  
I'll make it more than  
  
Experience is not imagination  
You get what you believe in if you choose  
Somebody loves you  
I couldn't get no higher  
Fly away lovers can share  
And we'll be there  
  
Experience is not imagination  
You get what you believe in if you choose  
And one way or the other  
We can find another world we can run away to  
And I love you  
Experience is only what you make it  
You come together when you let yourself go  
And somebody loves you  
I couldn't get no higher  
Fly away lovers can share  
And we'll be there

"17","Ray Boltz","The Gift","For them there were no presents  
Around the Christmas tree  
No flashing lights unless you count  
The lamp across the street  
A fire in a barrel  
No chimney and no roof  
To most of them Santa Claus  
Was the man who made the soup  
  
In an alley was a mother  
Two children by her side  
Trying hard to keep the spark  
Of true Christmas alive  
She said we may not have some things  
That other people do  
But Christmas is for everyone  
And were Gods children too  
  
Oh and Jesus loves you  
And so do I  
Think about the baby  
And the star up in the sky  
I don't think Santa's comin'  
Cause he don't know where we live  
But who needs Christmas presents  
We already have the gift  
  
Well early Christmas morning  
While they were still asleep  
I packed a box of food and clothes  
And walked back to their street  
Imagine my surprise  
When I saw presents all around  
Blankets, toys and winter coats  
Beside them on the ground  
And the card I read from Santa said  
Inside the three of you  
The real heart of Christmas  
Is still beating strong and true  
  
Oh and Jesus loves you  
And so do I  
Think about the baby  
And the star up in the sky  
Santa Claus is comin  
Cause he know where real faith lives  
But who needs Christmas presents  
We already have the gift  
Who needs Christmas presents  
We already have the gift  
Who needs Christmas presents  
We already have the gift

How I can love you and be burned  
And now I will build a wall  
To never get torn again

The girl you once loved  
Look at me now  
Grown up but still in love with you  
Although it's such a long, long time ago  
Such a long, long time ago  
Why did it ever have to be this way?  
You promised me the moon, the sun, the stars above  
How come you suddenly ceased to look my way?  
Tell me the truth that you are certain of  
Look at me now  
The girl you once loved  
Look at me now  
Grown up but still in love with you

"29","Arrogant Worms","Steel Drivin' Man","Special guest vocalist, Mike's dad: Bob McCormick  
(Mike's dad appears courtesy of Mike's mom)  
There once was a time when the country was wide. A time before cars and planes
and minivans. So, to move things from one place to the other, the railroad was
built. But it just didn't up and build itself. Nope, it was built by the
railroad men. And among these men was a man among men among men among men
among men among men, a man as tall as the sky and as wide as the land. A man
who could lay track faster than anyone else could run. A man with the strength
of ten men. His name was John Henry, and I'm not gonna sing about him. No, I'm
gonna sing about a lesser know figure, one who doesn't deserve a song. A man
as lazy as a thousand men. A man who could barely raise his own body off the
ground. A man who was barely a man at all. His name was Mike McCormick.  
Mike McCormick was a steel drivin' man  
Who never really gave a damn  
Only thing he worked on was his tan  
Mike McCormick was a steel drivin' man  
He'd get up in the morning to hammer in them spikes  
Unless he'd been up drinking the previous night  
Or if his bones weren't feeling right  
Or if it looked like it was going to rain  
He had a tendency of being late for work  
And everyone around thought he was a jerk  
He'd take long breaks and say his back was hurt  
Then he'd have a drink to ease the pain  
Mike McCormick was a steel drivin' man  
Who never really gave a damn  
Only thing he worked on was his tan  
Mike McCormick was a steel drivin' man  
Mike's dad: Mike! Mike! Get up, Mike!  
Mike: What, what is it?  
Mike's dad: Get up, it's time to go to work.  
Mike: Awww, already?  
Mike's dad: Well, don't you want to hammer in them spikes?  
Mike: No.  
Mike's dad: Oh.  
His arms were like twigs and his legs were like straws  
His hands were like a baby's bum they were so soft  
He'd wheeze and moan and whine and cough  
Then go home and take a little nap  
He never got fired 'cause he was the boss' son  
He just hung around and bothered everyone  
Never drove a spike, not a single one  
Though now and then he'd give a tap  
Mike McCormick was a steel drivin' man  
Who never really gave a damn  
Only thing he worked on was his tan  
Mike McCormick was a steel drivin' man  
Mike's dad: Mike! Mike! MIKE!  
Mike: What? What is it?  
Mike's dad: They say they got a big machine that they say can drive in nails
faster than any man alive.  
Mike: Sounds like a good idea.  
Mike's dad: No! No! No!  
Mike: Yeah, it'll work faster.  
Mike's dad: You don't understand! You see, it's gonna cost us all our jobs.
You, Mike McCormick, gotta prove 'em wrong!  
Mike: Okay.  
So he took his hammer and hammered one time (Ow!)  
He took his hammer and hammered two times (Oh, jeez!)  
He took his hammer and hammered three times (Ohhh!)  
Then he got crushed by a meteor and died  
Mike McCormick was a steel drivin' man  
Who never really gave a damn  
Only thing he worked on was his tan  
Mike McCormick was a steel drivin' man  
Mike McCormick was a steel drivin' man (steel drivin' maaaan)

You want Wyclef Jean, bring your same thug guys  
Here's my advice, leave the ring with your bride  
Cuz you aint comin back no more  
We gon send you to a vacation for two, with crabs on the seashore  
You freeze up, hold up I really thought you was psychotic  
Is that tears in your eyes? You cryin for your life  
Kid you tellin me what you did, you didn't wanna do  
Watch what you say on record cuz it might come true  
  
However you want it, you don't want it, cuz when you get it it hurts  
Your body carried out the church  
Mom, she be cryin holdin on to her purse sayin... (oh my baby!)  
They shoulda took me first  
However you want it, you don't want it, cuz when you get it it hurts  
Your body carried out the church  
Mom, she be cryin holdin on to her purse sayin... (oh...)  
  
Should I take them? Should I wait?  
Should I take them? Should I wait?  
Should I take them? Should I wait?  
I say ""No Woman, No Cry"" like I should own a piece of the estate  
But at the tribute they didn't invite me  
So I put in a call to Halis Alassi  
He said be easy, aint no need to bust a shot (BLOW! BLOW! BLOW! BLOW!)  
Like Supercat said, yo the ghetto's red hot  
Before bling, bling, bling it was BLING, BLING, BLING!

"38","Paul McCartney","All Things Must Pass","Sunrise doesn't last all morning  
A cloudburst doesn't last all day  
Seems my love is up and has  
Left you with no warning  
It's not always been this gray  
All things must pass  
All things must pass away  
Sunset doesn't last all evening  
A mind can blow those clouds away  
After all this, my love is up  
And must be leaving  
It's not always been this gray  
All things must pass  
All things must pass away  
All things must pass  
None of life's dreams can last  
So, I must be on my way  
To face another day  
And darkness only stays at nighttime  
In the morning it will fade away  
Daylight is good, at arriving at the right time  
It's not always gonna be this gray  
All things must pass  
All things must pass away  
All things must pass  
All things must pass away

"39","Cher","Love Enough","Something goes wrong,Something goes right,  
And it ever punishes or strokes our pride.  
Never stop to think how much we lose,  
When we pick and chose in out solitude.  
  
Sothing comes up, Something goes down,  
Suddenly you feel your being pushed around,  
And just becuse you think your losin hold,  
You try to take control, the stories very old.  
  
But if we ever get our minds made up  
All we gotta do is love enough,  
Won't be long before it comes to you  
Given love enough, you'll see it through  
All you gotta do is love enough  
  
Someone wants in, someone wants out  
But doesnt't't't anybody see beyond the clouds,  
Cause man you've hardly learned to speak your name  
Before your in this game  
But baby all the same  
  
But if we ever get our minds made up  
All we gotta do is love enough,  
Won't be long before it comes to you  
Given love enough, you'll pull it through  
All you gotta do is love enough  
  
All you really gotta do is love enough  
Wont be long before it comes to you  
Given love enough, you'll see it through  
All you gotta do is love enough

Like in your eyes, I see my future in an instant

I think I found my best friend  
I know that it might sound  
More than a little crazy  
But I believe  
  
I knew I loved you before I met you  
I think I dreamed you into life  
I knew I loved you before I met you  
I have been waiting all my life  
  
There's just no rhyme or reason  
Only the sense of completion  
And in your eyes, I see  
The missing pieces I'm searching for  
I think I've found my way home  
I know that it might sound  
More than a little crazy  
But I believe  
  
I knew I loved you before I met you  
I think I dreamed you into life  
I knew I loved you before I met you  
I have been waiting all my life  
  
A thousand angels dance around you  
I am complete now that I've found you

We can hope for the future

She turned for one last look  
She looked me in the eye

Go on and do it, Go!  
  
Leaving in a world  
When is plenty  
So how  
I come running and empty  
When we been touch  
By so many  
And still  
There's more without many  
Without any life, hope,  
Dreams, golds, you know

You know you got to do  
What you can  
You know you got  
To try to understand

To satisfy my Mom and Pop

I guess my head was full of nothing but rock  
I guess my head was full of nothing but rock  
  
Hear they're swinging the Fox Trot at the hotel  
Hear the country picking 'round the clock  
Pick up some sounds of the jazz around  
But if you dig what you hear, you dig rock  
Ah, if you dig what you hear, you dig rock  
  
The thing I'm gon' tell my dick jock  
So he can sock it to me 'round the clock  
Spend an hour of Bach in his original rock  
And if you dig what he's playing, you dig rock  
And if you dig what he's playing, you dig rock

"62","Luther Vandross","Nights In Harlem","There's a party in Harlem, come on  
  
I like to reminisce about that night we kissed  
It was somewhere one night in Harlem  
The nights were hot and bright  
You could treat your honey right  
?Cause Sylvia's would burn all night  
  
The people there were really something  
(You know that's right)  
The music always kept us jumping  
And it used to knock me down  
When Smokey came to town  
(And the miracles, please)  
My favorite song was ""Tears Of A Clown"", oh yeah  
  
There ain't nothing like them nights in Harlem  
They really shake the funk up there  
Tonight I'm gonna stomp in Harlem  
And I'm gonna take my baby back  
To the heart of Harlem  
  
Big sister had a group  
And they'd sit out on the stoop  
And Lordy could they harmonize (Oh yeah)  
My cousin Joe could blow  
Just like the radio  
And he used to drove them ""B"" girls wild  
  
But when grandma started happy dancing  
(Oh, she gon' break somethin')  
She really turned the mother out  
I like the way they do it up in Harlem  
When there's a party up in Harlem  
That's what it's all about  
  
Ain't nothing like them nights in Harlem  
They never fake the funk up there  
I met my Cherie Amour in Harlem  
And tonight I'm gonna take her back to the 'pollo  
  
There's a party in Harlem  
They say that all the stars will be there  
Everyone is going to Harlem  
Harlem is a party and everybody's going there  
  
Follow me visually, ?cause I usually be all around  
Originally everybody headed uptown  
Finessing the fly way you ?cruisin in your car  
On the West Side to the highway, East Side D-R  
And yes, we are about to set it  
Forget it, I thought you knew  
The Apollo is where I had to go with my crew  
From BMW's to my daddy's Cadillac  
He had the sunroof top wit the diamond in the back  
Check the ambiance, the place a renaissance  
Who frontin' nonchalant up in the restaurant  
What you really really want, we grabbin' by the clutch  
Precise can flaunt with this and never too much  
It's such a love flow, high but natural  
The thug's a no-show, and drugs a no-no  
The only thing that they was shootin' was pool  
While Harlem nights was right, the party was cool  
  
Nothing like them nights in Harlem  
They really shake the funk up there  
Tonight I'm gonna stomp in Harlem  
I'm gonna take my baby back to the heart of Harlem  
  
Nights in Harlem  
They never fake the funk up there  
I met my Cherie Amour in Harlem  
Back to the Harlem Apollo  
  
Nights in Harlem  
They don't let you fake the funk up there  
Tonight I'm gonna stomp in Harlem  
I'm gonna take my honey  
Back to the Harlem Apollo  
  
Nights in Harlem  
They really shake the funk up there  
Tonight I'm gonna stomp in Harlem  
I'm gonna take my baby  
Back to the Harlem Apollo

I think I could start again  
But every time we touch  
It reminds me of us, and

Every time I close my eyes  
To go to sleep at night  
I wake up and I see your face  
Even in my dreams  
I can't get anyplace  
I can't shake off your lovin' chains  
Your lovin' chains  
  
So I moved back east just to face my tears  
To say what needs sayin' before you disappear  
But old friends say you're gone  
Long since moved on, now

I think I'm never gonna climb this mountain  
Of my feelings for you  
I'm gonna have to live here in your shadow  
Until the skies are no longer blue!

Somebody tell me just what's goin' on  
  
Just can't get myself thinkin' straight  
I'm all shook up and in a terrible state  
Sometimes I think I got it all figured out  
Then you do something new and it just knocks me right out  
  
Someday baby I'm going to have to make a stand  
The way that you treat me baby  
Don't make me feel too much like a man  
And baby, baby, the changes you're goin' through  
You're drivin' me half crazy  
Can't make up my mind what to do about you.  
  
Tellin' myself that time is on my side  
You're gettin' this feelin' that my mind's on the slide  
Dumped on the floor, I feel I'm trapped in a spin  
Don't know how to end, can't think of where to begin  
  
She don't care I know she don't even try  
But when she turns it on  
You know she gets me so high.  
  
She's a lady that's making my life a sin  
You know that I'm runnin' in a losin' race  
There ain't no way I can win  
Baby, baby, the changes you're goin' through  
They're drivin' me half crazy  
Can't make up my mind what to do about you.

Sometimes I tell little lies to see if your eyes are looking through me  
But you know lying's not my style  
I just need your smile coming to me  
Reassuring me  
My world begins with havin' a friend when I'm feeling blue  
My world would end if ever I heard you say we were through  
Just don't know what I'd do  
'Cause my world begins and ends with you

Now some women say they don't want nothing,  
But a sweet talkin' bull of a man,  
I've heard it before, I can't hear it no more  
'cause they all take whatever they can,  
  
But, still I want a heartbreaker,  
A love maker, a soul shaker,  
A women who can turn me on,  
For a just little hit an' run, hit an' run  
  
She can be a love stealer,  
A double dealer, a free wheeler  
As long as she can turn me on  
For just a little hit an' run,  
A little bit of hit an' run  
  
You can keep your lock and key  
No ball and chain can harness me.  
Take me home tonight,  
Love and treat me right  
But, in the morning you'll find me gone,  
I hit an' run.

Too young to really be in love  
They say that loves a word  
A word we've only heard  
But can't begin to know  
The meaning of  
  
And yet we're not too young to know  
This love will last though years may go  
And then some day they may recall  
We were not too young at all

Coming up in the early morning  
I feel love and the shock of the lightning  
I'll follow into the blinding light

Love is a time machine  
Up on the silver screen  
It's all in my mind  
Love is a litany  
A magical mystery  
And all in good time  
And all in good time  
And all in good time  
  
I've got my feet on the street but I can't stop flying  
My head's in the clouds but at least I'm trying  
I'm outta control but I'm tied up tight  
Come in, come out tonight  
  
There's a hole in the ground into which I'm falling  
So God speed to the sound of the pounding  
I'm all in to the blinding light  
Come in, come out, come in, come out tonight

"80","Howard Jones","Gun Turned On The World","You're walkin' 'round like a doll without a head  
You should be thinking 'bout how to give your love instead  
I've seen you lying and cheating your way  
Then you complain about what all of your friends say  
You shoot your mouth like you damn well own the world  
We always have to keep our little white flags unfurled  
Just try to finish the things that you start  
Stop thinking with your fists  
And start thinking with your heart  
Oh can't you see  
Oh what you could be now  
You never listen to me  
Oh you're like a gun turned on the world  
Things have to be attempted one step at a time  
You got to take that poison from your eyes  
You know the lights are going out in your life  
Your killing yourself with your own knife  
Oh can't you see  
Oh what you could be now  
You never listen to me  
Oh you're like a gun turned on the world  
You don't want a love you need a chaperone  
You want a first-class alibi  
You bore the pants off people on the telephone  
People are sick of your lies  
You better open your eyes  
You're like a gun turned on the world, like a gun  
You're takin' one step forward then two steps back  
Friendly advice gets treated like a heart attack  
You can drown in the shallow water of hate  
Get the sense before it's too late now  
Oh can't you see  
Oh what you could be now  
You never listen to me  
Oh you're like a gun turned on the world  
Oh can't you see  
Oh what you could be now  
You never listen to me  
Oh you're like a gun turned on the world

A statement from his former life

Beside him was an empty throne

Affix his gaze, his features staid  
Grasps the handle, clips the cable  
One steps up, sits at his table  
My friend, my friend, he's got a knife  
My friend, my friend, he's got a wife

Persuasion through his thoughts peruse  
A hidden relic from his past  
That wasn't there when he looked last  
He feels it ticking like a bomb  
Feeding fear, assaulting calm  
Takes the object, starts the game  
Moves closer to the flame

Too many dry martinis  
And cans of beer to sink  
  
Another day, already night

I could call my Rhianna  
Ask her to meet me now  
I think I lost her number

Or I could stay in bed

Night is near  
I'm still in bed  
Red curtain  
Soft wind  
Sunlight  
And I was red  
  
On the papers  
On the floor  
We did watch possessed  
  
People, push and pull it  
Moss turf, and other lads  
My head's still full of poison  
What I do is insane  
I should, perhaps, move out of here  
Or take a plane to Spain  
  
Refrigerator's noise  
I'll get out, the only choice  
Should I get up right now  
Wait for me somehow  
Don't want to know what for  
To get out of this door  
Should I phone Debbie Meier?  
Is this the one desire?  
I look into the mirror  
My eyes can't be in error  
The sun's now really gone  
Perhaps I am the one  
Nothing can creep in sight  
I'm turning on the lights  
  
Turning on the lights  
I'm turning on the lights (5x)  
  
The sun's now really gone  
Perhaps I am the one

It's no secret you feel better if you cry

But it's only false emotions that you feel  
If your heartaches seem to hang around too long  
And your blues keep gettin' bluer with each song  
Remember sunshine can be found behind the cloudy sky  
So let your head down and go on and cry  
If your heartaches...

Sometimes you get sick  
And don't get better

So you pretend not to notice  
That everything has changed  
The way that you look  
And the friends you once had  
So you keep on acting the same  
But deep down in your soul  
You know you, you got no flame  
And who knows then which way to go  
Life is short even in its longest days  
  
All I got here  
Is a rear view mirror  
Reflections of where I've been  
So you tell yourself I'll be back up on top some day  
But you know there's nothing waiting up there for you anyway  
  
Nothing lasts forever  
And your best efforts don't always pay  
Sometimes you get sick

"97","Counting Crows","Low","(Original by Cracker)  
  
Sometimes I wanna take you down.  
Sometimes I wanna get you low.  
Brush your hair back from your eyes.  
Take you down let the river flow.  
Sometimes I go and walk the street  
Behind the green sheet of glass.  
A million miles below their feet  
A million miles, a million miles  
CHORUS:  
I'll be with you girl  
Like being low  
Hey hey hey like being stoned.  
I'll be with you girl  
Like being low  
Hey hey hey like being stoned.  
A million poppies gonna make me sleep.  
Just one rose and knows your name  
The fruit is rusting on the vine  
The fruit is calling from the trees  
Hey don't you wanna go down  
Like some junkie cosmonaut  
A million miles below their feet  
A million miles a million miles  
CHORUS  
Blue blue is the sun.  
Brown brown is the sky.  
Green green of her eyes.  
A million miles a million miles  
Hey hey don't you wanna go down  
Like some disgraced cosmonaut  
A million miles below their feet  
A million miles a million miles

"98","Ella Fitzgerald","Born To Be Blue","Some folks were meant to live in clover,  
But they are such a chosen few  
And clover being green is something I've never seen  
Cause I was born to be blue  
  
When there's a yellow moon above me,  
They say there's moonbeams I should view  
But moonbeams being gold are something I can't behold  
Cause I was born to be blue  
  
When I met you the world was bright and sunny  
When you left the curtain fell  
I'd like to laugh but nothing strikes me funny  
Now my world's a faded pastel  
  
Well, I guess I'm luckier than some folks,  
I've known the thrill of loving you  
And that alone is more than I was created for  
Cause I was born to be blue

"100","Fastball","Out Of My Head","Sometimes I feel like I'm drunk behind the wheel  
the wheel of possibility  
However it may roll, give it a spin  
See if you can somehow factor in  
You know there's always more than one way  
to say exactly what you mean to say  
  
Was I out of my head or was I out of my mind?  
How could I have ever been so blind?  
I was waiting for an indication, it was hard to find  
Don't matter what I say, only what I do  
I never mean to do bad things to you  
So quiet but I finally woke up  
If you're sad then it's time you spoke up too

And I ain't made my bed in a week

And Yes, I know our differences pulled us apart  
Never spoke a word heart to heart  
And I'm glad that you're gone  
But I wish to the lord that you'd come home  
And I'm glad that you're gone  
Got the feeling so strong  
And I'm glad that you're gone  
But I wish to the lord that you'd come home  
  
Well my guitar still plays your favorite song  
though the strings have been outta tune for some time  
Every time I strum a cord, I pray out to the lord  
That you'll quit your honkey-tonkin' sing my song  
And I'm glad that you're gone  
Got the feeling so strong  
And I'm glad that you're gone  
But I wish to the lord that you'd come home  
  
So I'll throw another log onto the fire  
And I'll admit I'm a lousy liar  
As the coals die down and flicker  
I hear that guitar picker  
Play the song we used to sing so long ago  
I'm glad that you're gone  
Got the feeling so strong  
And I'm glad that you're gone  
But I wish to the lord that you'd come home  
And I'm glad, damn glad you're gone  
Got the feeling so strong  
And I'm glad that you're gone

I'm just a heartbeat away  
Saying goodbye isn't saying were through  
Just know through it all I'm still here for you  
Light a light in the window  
When your lost in the dark, ooh  
These arms would be happy to hold you again  
If ever you miss me or when you  
Start thinking about  
All the nights that we shared

Hope that you'll look back someday

Sometimes the tears will flow.  
Some of my memories will fade,  
But I'll always remember that one September day.  
I used to reminisce  
'Cause I thought that love was bliss.  
How did they know it would go astray?  
It began, and it ended on one September day.  
We met by chance,  
As people often do,  
But it blossomed, yes, it blossomed  
Into something I never knew.  
Now... It is in the past.  
They said it would never last.  
I'll not forget the moment back,  
Nor hot May or December,  
Nor June or November,  
But one September day.

Well look at me, i'm coming back again  
I got a taste of love in a simple way  
And if you need to know while i'm still standing you just fade away  
  
Don't you know i'm still standing better than i ever did  
Looking like a true survivor, feeling like a little kid  
I'm still standing after all this time  
Picking up the pieces of my life without you on my mind  
  
I'm still standing yeah yeah yeah  
I'm still standing yeah yeah yeah

To conquer, stomp ya like that cat Blanca  
Toy Tonka truck ten carat on ya monsta  
Ring Rocky like fuck switch sides like water rides  
The DAT bubble life preserve the other guys  
Now FUCK Y'ALL act wilda  
The style wilda than a praying mantis  
Chillin' like  
  
As my brothers and I reign rebellious, changin'  
The courses of time, devils no longer exist  
As God Cypher Divine, all minds one no question  
Now check it  
Perhaps we can go through Lessons  
Or might SHOT me a pussy protestin'  
Comin' with that lip professin', you must take  
Allah for fool, where's his Jewel  
Was he usin' Mathematics as a tool?  
Tell me, the struggle is God and I came to build  
Shit is so real, inside you distilled  
Back in the form of mist  
You wishin' you did the Knowledge before speakin'  
Seekin', where you went wrong  
And why would I bring you such physical harm?  
  
Yo, mind arson, my squadren, surround the Sound-Garden  
Guns for hire plus you under fire and a target  
Sniper in the cypher, I, Pied Piper  
Move the housing by the thousand, I watched out the Chrysler  
Bombs strike ya like the mighty Thor, blast the door  
Recite a page like a tidal wave, past the shore  
Two pulls, I'm wild like mechanical bulls  
Pack a full house, it's girls night out, pull a hairful  
Heavenly laced, stimulation make you feel slow paced  
I motivate and await my sober state  
  
Magnificent, heavenly the God stay bent  
Five Percent Range whippin' soul controller of the lynch  
Mackin phone rings, Stephen King trauma down at Danzine  
My mood swings, suplexed off the rope, magazine  
Coconut jewels, wore no color shoe, knife annual  
Moses lost his sandal, hidin the manual  
Blow the vandal buggin off of Bon Jovi hits  
Grammer lo-ve, famous murder weapon was a trophy  
Seize posin in Oshkosh, guzzle cries  
Sabotage massage rap bandit at large  
Wolverine Carnation Milk, Wu denim jeans  
Thurston Howell the Third kid's back on the scene  
Call it chopped meat, cause every word is choppy  
My logic crunch all crows to death, Kobiyashi couldn't stop me  
Gettin' caught up in my world, Haagen-Daaz world  
Backflip and then twirl, cave your whole world in

That I won't be home anymore  
For somethin' happened to me as I was driving home  
And I'm not the same anymore  
  
Oh, I was only 24 hours from Tulsa  
Oh, only one day away from your arms  
And I saw a welcoming light  
And stopped to rest for the night  
  
And that is when I saw him as I pulled in outside  
Of the small motel he was there  
And so I walked up to him, asked where I could get something  
To eat and he showed me where  
  
Oh, I was only 24 hours from Tulsa  
Oh, only one day away from your arms  
He took me to a cafe  
And he asked me if I would stay, I said okay  
  
Oh, I was only 24 hours from Tulsa  
Oh, only one day away from your arms  
The jukebox started to play  
And nighttime turned into day  
  
As we were dancing closely all of a sudden  
I lost control, as he held me tight  
And then he kissed me, caressed me  
Told me, he'd die before he would let me out of his arms  
  
Oh, I was only 24 hours from Tulsa  
Oh, only one day away from your arms  
I hate to do this to you  
But I found somebody new, what can I do  
  
And I can never, never, never go home again

""Fag,"" he mumbles.  
I don't mind.  
He's fat.  
No one likes him.  
Life's too short.  
I pass a table of black girls  
With short hair.  
They look like men.  
They all look the same.  
I can hear the strobe now,  
It's loud.  
And the music's too bright.  
I look for my friends,  
But I can't remember if I came alone  
Or not.  
Doesn't matter though.  
There's hundreds of people  
Who have waited all their lives,  
No doubt,  
To be my friend.  
And as I near the bar  
I see two persons  
Eating each other's faces.  
I bark to the bartender.  
He gives me a placebo.  
I'm ""so young,"" he tells me,  
""To be here.""  
I nod and swallow the bland drink.  
Then I stumble several times  
Near a crowd,  
And they think I'm a good dancer.  
I hear a girl tell another girl  
That some girl she knows  
Watched a  
Girl  
Puke in the toilet.  
I smile in their general direction.  
The good-looking one comes over  
And bites my cheek.  
It hurts,  
And I start to  
Hit her.  
But she's grinning,  
And I can see my blood on her teeth.  
And I pull her to me.  
""My place or yours?""  
""The gutter will be fine,"" she confesses.  
As we walk out,  
She takes another bite from my cheek,  
And I smile at the fat man  
By the door.

I control the mind straight over the phone,  
Let 'em explore the words something like a tourist,  
They never get addicted unless the headywop is serious  
From Louisdales to Jimmy Choos is real,  
She knows the time she sees the richard mille,  
Flat double skeletal tourbillon  
Its just like her body move it turns her on,  
She like the way my hands use her body for hand warmers,  
And all our car doors go up like Transformers  
See i can do it thisaway i can do it thataway  
From the crib in Viginia to that new Miami getaway  
So cool like new edition that she hollas ya scent,  
I'll get it ok, let it boil away,  
But please run along, cuz ladeez is feelin wrong,  
And I got some right for 'em right after this song  
Cuz my name is Skate-Board-P  
  
Ladies and gentlemen,  
  
Can i have it like that?  
You got it like that  
Can i have it like that?  
You got it like that  
Can i have it like that?  
You got it like that  
Can i have it like that?

And act like ya tryin' to get this money right quick,  
So can i have it like that?  
You got it like that  
Can i have it like that?  
You got it like that  
  
On and on and the temperatures warming  
I spit heat flashes, niggaz get nautious,  
Bright as a bitch  
So analyze with caution  
When the light hit the ice bet a 100 that you vomit  
Should i mention the fact the transition is the track  
No one change into the vision just to get me where I'm at  
No skateboy P too grown  
Riding up and down college in that new 2 tone  
It's so cold you dont wanna feel the chill of it, (Uh!)  
Just stand back and just look at the grill of it, (Uh!)  
I don't smoke but i bet the... love it!  
It totally intensifies vivd ass appeal of it,  
  
You could be jealous, and grit ya teeth,  
But all these little nigaas got something in reach  
  
While on my boat party trying to sunseek,  
  
Ladies and gentlemen,  
  
Can i have it like that?  
You got it like that  
Can i have it like that?  
You got it like that

Noah is fixing the pump in the rain  
He brings us no shame  
We always knew that he always knew  
Up over the hill  
Jovial neighbors come down when they will  
With stories to tell  
Sometimes they do  
Yes sometimes we do  
We have a rocking chair  
Each of us rocks his share  
Eating muffin buns and berries  
By the steamy kitchen window  
Sometimes we do  
Our tongues turn blue

Anywhere else now would seem very strange  
The seasons are changing  
Everyday in everyway  
Sometimes it is spring  
Sometimes it is not anything  
A poet can sing  
Sometimes we try  
Yes we always try  
We have a rocking chair  
Somedays we rock and stare  
At the woodlands and the grasslands and the badlands 'cross the river  
Sometimes we do  
We like the view

To wade through the grain  
You always do

Come back to the stars  
Sweet well water and pickling jars  
We'll lend you the car  
We always do  
Yes sometimes we do  
We have a rocking chair  
Someone is always there  
Rocking rhythms while they're waiting with the candle in the window  
Sometimes we do  
We wait for you

Put on your armour  
Ragged after fights  
Hold up your sword  
You're leaving the light  
  
Make yourself ready  
For the lords of the dark  
They'll watch your way  
So be cautious, quiet and hark  
  
You hear them whispering  
In the crowns of the trees  
You're whirling 'round  
But your eyes don't agree  
  
Will'o'the wisps  
Misguiding your path  
You can't throw a curse  
Without takin' their wrath  
  
Watch out for the seas of hatred and sin  
Or all us people forget what we've been  
Our only hope's your victory  
Kill that Satan who won't let us be--kill!  
  
[Chorus]  
You're the Keeper of the Seven Keys  
That lock up the seven seas  
And the Seer of Visions said before he went blind  
Hide them from demons and rescue mankind  
Or the world we're all in will soon be sold  
To the throne of the evil payed with Lucifer's gold  
  
You can feel cold sweat  
Running down your neck  
And the dwarfs of falseness  
Throw mud at your back  
  
Guided by spells  
Of the old Seer's hand  
You're suffering pain  
Only steel can stand  
  
Stay well on your way and follow the sign  
Fulfull your own promise and do what's divined  
The seven seas are far away  
Placed in the valley of dust heat and sway

Throw the first key into the sea of hate  
  
Throw the second key into the sea of fear  
Throw the third key into the sea of senselessness  
And make the people hold each other's hands  
The fourth key belongs into the sea of greed  
  
And the fifth into the sea of ignorance  
Disease, disease, disease my friend  
For this whole world's in devil's hand  
Disease, disease, disease my friend  
Throw the key or you may die  
  
On a mound at the shore of the last sea  
He is sitting, fixing your sight  
With his high iron voice causing sickness  
He is playing you out with delight  
  
""Man who do you just think you are?  
A silly bum with seven stars  
Don't throw the key or you will see  
Dimensions cruel as they can be""  
  
Don't let him suck off your power  
Throw the key...!  
  
An earthquake, squirting fire, bursting ground  
Satan's screaming, and earth swallowing him away!  
  
You're the Keeper of the Seven Keys  
You locked up the Seven Seas  
And the Seer of Visions can now rest in peace  
There ain't no more demons and no more disease  
And mankind, live up, you're free again  
Yes the tyrant is dead, he is gone, overthrown  
You have given our souls back to light

Inside my heart, I keep a little box  
It is the box of memories I created about you  
  
Chorus  
You are the one, you are the one.  
  
Whenever I miss you bad,  
I walk around the park  
Looking at little boys and girls  
They remind me of you  
There's a lot of stories I'd like to share with you  
There's a lot of games, I'd like to play with you  
Tears come down my face  
When I think about what happened  
  
The lawyer spoke to the judges  
Told them I was not good around you  
The judges gave your mother a letter,  
That is keeping me away from you.  
Don't worry, you are never far from me.  
Inside my heart I keep a little box,  
It is a box of memories I created about you.

You are the one, you are the one.

We spoke with eyes instead  
We looked into each other like long lost friends  
But then you went away  
And I never heard  
You had a summer haunt  
You said the ice would kill  
But you would not be caught

Remember me, I will never betray you

I slept a thousand hours  
My heart felt cold as a cowards  
You sent a southern breeze like forest fire  
I heard those voices too  
I dreamed each dream with you  
We breathe as one together and shed our tears  
But then I woke with you  
And my dream came true  
I'll never hold you here  
I know when winter comes that you will disappear

And once again our heart is broken.  
And as history repeats itself.  
These few words are sadly spoken.  
  
I've passed this way before.  
I've felt this pain before.  
A hurt that took so long to end.  
Has found my poor heart again.  
  
As I watch love walking away.  
It brings back old memories.  
But a familiar pain still feels the same.  
Once again, heartache has found me.  
  
A dark cloud covered my heart.  
Oh, when she told me goodbye.  
Now there's nothing left but emptiness.  
And the tears that filled my crying eyes.  
  
I've passed this way before.  
I've felt this pain before.  
A hurt that took so long to end.  
Has found my poor heart again.  
  
No matter how strong a man is.  
Without a love he walks in the dark, baby.  
If love deserts him it would surely hurt him.  
'Cause his weakness is his heart.  
  
A lonely journey now stands before me.  
The endless pain has started.  
But this time I know the way.  
Walking alone and broken hearted.  
  
Because I've passed this way before.  
And I've felt this pain before.  
A hurt that took so long to end.  
Has found my poor heart again.

I'm really sorry that I can't be there but work comes first, I'm sure you'll
understand.  
Things are really taking off for me business is thriving and I'm showing a
profit and.  
And in any case it wouldn't be the same, cause we've all grown up and we've
got our lives

must be paid

must admit  
We had a laugh, but that's all it was and ever will be, cause the burning sky
keeps  
Burning bright. and as long as it does (and it always will), there's no time
for dreams  
When commerce calls. and the taxmans shouting cause he wants his dough and the
wheels of  
Finance won't begin to slow.  
  
And its only us realists who are gonna come through cause there's only one

next week,  
With the head of a big corporate I can't disclose who but I'm sure you'll know
it and.  
And the burning sky, keeps burning bright. and it won't turn off til its had
enough,  
Its the greedy bastard who won't give up, and you're just a dreamer if you
don't realize,  
And the sooner you do will be the better for you, then well all be happy and
well all be  
Wise and all bow down to the burning sky.  
  
Then well all be happy and well all be wise and together we will live beneath
the  
Burning sky.

So much for liberation  
They'll have a celebration  
Yeah I've been under too much stress  
  
And as the cloud begin to rumble  
So the juggler makes his fumble  
And the sun upon my wall is getting less  
  
Don't, give a damn  
Fight, while you can  
Kill, shoot em up  
They'll run amuck  
Shout, Judas  
Loud, they'll hear us  
Soldier, sailor  
They'll run for cover when they discover  
Everyone's a nervous wreck now  
  
I used to think she was so nimble  
Would have bought her as symbol  
But now I can't afford the pen to sign her checks  
  
Don't, give a damn

Well give as good as we get now  
Rise from the gutter, stick with each other  
Well drive em over the edge now  
They're gonna bleed, that's what they need  
Well get together and blow their cover  
Were ready  
Yeah we're ready

Transmissions burning down the wire.

Live life in extreme  
Better then any magazine could ever hope to describe.  
Ripped, we sweat this desert dance, baby do your best.  
We're on our way to higher consciousness.  
We reach out for the sky  
And we're never coming down.  
Keep reaching, keep reaching.

High on a million breaths of her,  
I surrender to the magic all around me.  
We reach out for the sky  
And we're never coming down.

Cause you might enjoy some madness for a while

Find someone to satisfy you

And when you finally get to the old folks home you can finally act your age  
I can make a million dollars  
And you can spend it as fast as it comes  
And you can sit there and cry on a bed full of lies  
And be thinking that you got you some  
  
They'll be songs about me  
They'll be songs about you  
They'll be songs about everything from money to blues  
But there wont be no songs about regret  
Because I ain't wrote no songs like that yet  
No I ain't wrote no songs like that yet  
  
You can hear me on the radio  
You can see me on TV  
You'll have to dig you a hole just to find your soul  
And get you a word from me  
You can run as fast as a hour glass  
You can fly as high as the wind  
You can be as strong for as long as you like  
But you'll end up right back where you been  
  
They'll be songs about me  
They'll be songs about you  
They'll be songs about everything from money to blues  
But there wont be no songs about regret  
Because I ain't wrote no songs like that yet  
No I ain't wrote no songs like that yet  
  
I got a song for every occasion  
I been told I got a way with words  
I been told I'd be loved forever  
I been sold on the lies that I heard  
I been bold in my days  
Been gold in my ways  
Been packed up and rolled out  
And thrown out the way  
I belong to a song, for as long as I say  
But I'll always have a song to play  
  
They'll be songs about me  
They'll be songs about you  
They'll be songs about everything from money to blues  
But there wont be no songs about regret  
Cause I ain't wrote no songs like that yet

"202","Ray Charles","People Will Say We're In Love","Why do they think up stories that link my name with yours?  
Why do the neighbors chatter all day, behind their doors?  
I know a way to prove what they say is quite untrue.  
Here is the gist, a practical list of ""donts"" for you.  
  
Don't throw bouquets at me  
Don't please my folks too much  
Don't laugh at my jokes too much  
People will say we're in love!  
  
Don't sigh and gaze at me  
Your sighs are so like mine  
Your eyes mustn't glow like mine  
People will say we're in love!  
  
Don't start collecting things  
Give me my rose and my glove.  
Sweetheart they're suspecting things  
People will say we're in love.  
  
Don't praise my charm too much  
Don't look so vain with me  
Don't stand in the rain with me  
People will say we're in love!  
  
Don't take my arm too much  
Don't keep your hand in mine  
Your hand feels so grand in mine  
People will say we're in love!  
  
Don't dance all night with me  
Till the stars fade from above.  
They'll see it's alright with me  
People will say we're in love.

People, don't you care 'bout what they say?  
Deceivers, they break you down and make you pay  
Brothers, they don't understand any word you say  
  
All your life you are fighting  
They're trying to force you in  
  
When the time has come  
You'll not be alone  
Cause walls broke down  
They'll see they were wrong  
When the time has come  
There'll be more of you  
With all their strength  
You'll show them the truth  
  
Mistreaters, they don't care, but fear your will  
Sisters, they don't understand any word you say  
  
All your life you are fighting  
They're trying to force you in  
  
When the time has come  
You'll not be alone  
Cause walls broke down  
They'll see they were wrong  
When the time has come  
You ain't no fool  
Cause walls broke down  
They stop being cruel  
When the time has come  
There'll be more of you  
With all their strength  
You'll show them the truth

When he leaves me he wears a smile now  
As soon as he's away from me  
In your arms is where he wants to be  
  
But you're the one he rushes home to  
You're the one he gave his name to  
I never see his face in the early morning light  
You have his mornings, his daytimes  
And sometimes I have his nights  
  
But does he love you (does he love you)  
Like he loves me (like he loves me)  
Does he think of you (does he think of you)  
When he's holding me  
And does he whisper (does he whisper) all of his fantasies  
Does he love you (does he love you) like he's been lovin' me  
  
But when he's with me, he says he needs me  
And that he wants me, that he believes in me  
  
And when I'm in his arms, oh he swears there's no one else  
Is he deceiving me, or am I deceiving myself?  
  
But does he love you (does he love you)  
Like he loves me (like he loves me)

"206","Marillion","Three Minute Boy","Here today  
Gone this afternoon  
Another tune we almost remember  
What's the story  
Sex and drugs again  
Business as usual  
The clock's already ticking  
La la la la  
  
When he was young  
Staring at the TV  
He watched the fun happenin' to other people  
Now they scream  
As they run after him  
Like a dream  
Like Elvis and the Beatles  
  
A three minute song is all he wrote  
He only did it for a joke  
They played him on the radio  
From Tokyo to Timbuktu  
A three minute boy, ain't that somethin'  
They named their children after him  
The good times rolled beneath his feet  
He skipped along the one-way street  
  
She's a pretty girl  
She don't know how it started  
She made a movie  
He almost remembered  
She measured up  
They moved into a basement  
""We're so in love!""  
They giggled to the nation  
La la la la  
  
Three minute millionaire they said  
The numbers rattled round his head  
They spun him three times round the globe  
She waited patiently at home  
And all the pretty girls wanted him  
In places that he'd never been  
Too much love will do you in  
Forgive Forgive Forgive Forgive  
Yeah Yeah Ooo  
  
Three minute kid is here again  
Surrounded by three minute friends  
He found someone to understand  
To shock the world and hold his hand  
No religion, no restraint  
No direction, no complaints  
No future and no way out  
No time now to think about it  
All the money's gone  
He don't know what he spent it on  
  
Girlfriends gone off with the Jag  
Gone back to her mum and dad  
He's curled up on the studio floor  
He just can't do it anymore  
The flashgun went off without warning  
He'll read about it tomorrow morning  
  
She's goin' out with someone new  
In this week at number two  
Three minute boy ain't that somethin'

They stay with me till you come home again  
You brought me every mis'ry that there is but God gave me a heart to forgive  
You hurt me as much as you can

Say too much guitar music, tequila, salt and lime  
Blame it on Mexico, but she's the reason  
That I fell in love again for my last time

In a rundown motel room as dark as hell  
I felt all the pains of a morning after  
And all alone as far as I could tell  
  
Why she left I have no way of knowing  
I guess she caught her train and that's a crime  
She took everything I ever wanted

Say too much guitar music, tequila, salt and lime  
Blame it on Mexico, but she's the reason

"220","Frank Sinatra","Don't Ever Be Afraid To Go Home","Don't ever be afraid to go home,  
Don't ever be afraid to go home,  
When you've hitched your wagon to a fast falling star,  
And the last string is broken on your love-sick guitar,  
  
Whatever you're doing and wherever you are,  
Don't ever be afraid, don't ever be afraid to go home,  
I used to be afraid to go home.  
But one day, I was made to go home,  
  
Now I was almost certain they would lock the door on me,  
'Cause I'm that sour apple on my old family tree.  
But folks who really love me made me welcome as could be,  
Don't ever be afraid, don't ever be afraid to go home.  
  
I used to be afraid to go home.  
But one day, I was made to go home,  
Now I was almost certain they would lock the door on me,  
'Cause I'm the sour apple on my old family tree.  
  
But the folks who really love me made me welcome as could be,  
Don't ever be afraid, don't you ever be afraid,  
Don't ever be afraid to go home.

Now that the hour hand has landed at the end  
Now that it's real  
Now that the dreams have given all they had to lend

Do I stay or do I go  
And maybe try another time  
And do I really have a hand in my forgetting  
  
Now that I've tried  
Now that I've finally found that this is not the way  
Now that I turn  
Now that I feel it's time to spend the night away  
I want to know  
Do I stay or do I go  
And maybe finally split the rind  
And do I really understand the undernetting  
  
Yes and the morning has me looking in your eyes and seeing mine  
Warning me to read the signs carefully  
  
Now that it's love  
Now that the candle's falling smaller in my mind  
Now that it's here  
Now that I'm almost not so very far behind  
I want to know  
Do I stay or do I go  
And maybe fall another side  
And do I really have a sound that I can ride on  
  
Now that I can  
Now that it's easy ever easy all around  
Now that I'm near  
Now that I'm falling to the sunlights and to song  
I want to know  
Do I stay or do I go  
And do I have to do just one  
And can I choose again if I should lose the reason  
  
Yes and the morning has me looking in your eyes and seeing mine  
Warning me to read the signs oh carefully  
  
Now that I smile  
Now that I'm laughing even deeper in the side  
Now that I see  
Now that I finally found the one thing I denied  
I want to know  
Do I stay or do I go  
And it is finally I decide  
That I'll be leaving in the fairest of the seasons

You poured whiskey in my Slurpee, swear to God you got me drunk  
Now, I'm thinking that I'm sunk and I can't swim  
I'm drowning in the back seat of a '61 Bel Air  
I got a mouthful of your hair, a handful of skin  
I ain't suffocating, I'm just sick and tired of waiting  
Stop this pointless hesitating, pull me in  
There's an awful lot of stars out here, an awful lot of sky  
I'm turning on the radio, they're playing 'Ready to ride'  
Before the band kicks in, the getting better start  
I'll stomp a mud hole in your heart  
We could cruise the lake like psychos  
Scare the kids on motorcycles, there ain't nothing I would rather do  
It's 3-D on the TV but it's empty on the street  
If it weren't for me and you, the avenue would be incomplete  
And I should say this before this whole thing even starts

She is awakening in dark swells and mystery.  
Unbridled night mares powerful and running free.  
You could still hear her cries reverberating through the trees...  
For the trampled flowers, the daughters of Eve, the Sisters of Avalon...  
Sisters Of Avalon...Sisters Of Avalon...  
  
They brought her in in a new white dress...  
But the stain left an ache on her mother's breast...

Where did the 20th century go?  
I'd swear it was here just a minute ago

I read all about it in true confession  
I'm sorry I was late for the recording session  
But somebody put me on hold.  
Has anybody seen my linoleum floors  
Petroleum jelly, and two world wars?  
They got stuck in the revolving doors  
All over this world.  
And now...  
  
The winter's getting colder, summer's getting hotter  
Wishin' well's wishin' for another drop of water.  
And mother earth's blushin'' 'cause somebody caught her  
Makin' love to the man in the moon.  
Tell me how you gonna keep 'em down on the farm  
Now that outer space has lost it's charm?  
Somebody set off a burglar alarm  
And not a moment too soon.  
Because...  
  
Old father time has got his toes a tappin'  
Standing in the window, grumblin' and a rappin'

In a one horse open sleigh  
Over the fields we go  
Laughing all the way  
Bells on bop tails ring  
Making spirits bright  
What fun it is to  
Ride a sleighing song tonight  
Jingle Bells  
Jingle Bells  
Jingle all the way  
Oh what fun it is to ride  
In a one horse open sleigh  
Jingle Bells  
Jingle Bells  
Jingle all the way  
Oh what fun it is to ride  
In a one horse open sleigh  
Jingle Bells

In a one horse open sleigh

"238","Roxette","Voices","I knew this would happen  
And I don't want to be around  
When it gets out.  
I've closed the last picture  
  
And painted the windows  
Inside and out.  
Give me your dreams  
And I'll give you my time,  
  
Together we'll cross the borderline.  
Voices -  
Cracking the night,  
Voices -  
  
That cut like a knife,  
Voices -  
Hear them singing...  
From sparks to the fire,  
  
From here to obsession they cover the end.  
Twisting a match  
And see the reflections of hunters of men.  
Give me your dreams  
  
And I'll give you my time,  
Until we make it to the borderline.  
Voices...

"239","Zebrahead","Runaway","She wakes up in the morning  
In the same room that she's been in her whole life  
And everything still looks the same  
But the feeling of the room has changed in spite  
  
She said  
""You don't know what it's like to be stuck in my mind""  
She said  
""You don't know what it's like to be stuck in my mind all the time""  
  
Bruised lips and the make-up  
Tattooed hips and pierced  
For the sake of letting everybody know  
She don't belong here  
Old tricks that she made up  
  
Attitude  
I don't give a fuck  
For the sake of letting everybody know  
She says I won't belong So long  
It's not a lost cause  
She's just a runaway  
  
Is there nothing left for you to say?  
And if she comes home  
Do you think she'll want to stay?  
Is there anything for her?  
She's a runaway  
Turn your back on yesterday  
She calls at seven thirty  
  
And wants to talk about her boyfriend one last time  
Mom and Dad are fighting in the background,  
Shattered glass cuts through red wine  
I said,  
""I don't know that I'm right but I know that you're wrong""  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Blacked out  
Passed out at a party  
In another town  
With the same old Bacardi  
Nothing ever changes what's inside me  
Someone find me, someone find me  
My heart showed me the way out  
  
Don't stop  
Don't give up on me now  
Two beats, two streets  
Too many repeats to blow my only other way out

She was living here  
Yea, she was living here

It isn't very clear, no it isn't very clear  
Into every life a little rain must fall  
And losing one you love is like a storm  
But storms are passing  
  
[Chorus]  
I hear Leesha  
Singing in heaven tonight  
And in between the sadness  
I hear Leesha  
Telling me that she's alright  
  
Life goes on even after life  
That's what I believe  
Yea, that's what I believe  
Leesha's gone, but she will still survive  
In a memory that I'm keeping here with me  
Silencing the voice of mortal tragedy  
Listening to whispers of the soul  
All is peaceful

"241","Willie Nelson","Blue Hotel","I'd like to say that I tried  
It fits in with all the suggestions and lies and empty tables  
With food untouched,  
I couldn't see the future.  
I liked the past too much  
I've been going door to door like I got something to sell,  
Wandering like a fool  
Through the halls of a blue hotel.  
  
So go on and rain down on us  
Go on and rain  
Go on and rain down on us  
I give up, I give up.  
  
Something about her that's cold.  
She's blowing through the trees,  
Leaving me raw  
As the words come out,  
I get confused.  
I get shattered like a light bulb in an October moon.  
She's inside me like a secret  
And I got no one to tell.  
Wandering like a fool  
Through the halls of a blue hotel.  
  
Go on and rain down on us  
Go on and rain  
Go on and rain down on us  
I give up.  
I give up.

Something that I usually leave unsaid

Let's lock the door, hide the key  
I'll try to look like you if you'll dress up like me  
And you play dumb and I'll play too, nobody has to know  
I wanna see my heart's reflection in your eyes  
In your eyes  
Let's jump this ship, let's cut out  
Let's get into the wagon and drive until the motor falls out  
I want just us two, I don't want to have to hide my heart  
I wanna see it in your eyes as we ride on and on

You'll wake up in the bed scratching  
Those inevitable fleas  
At ten years old  
You listen to what you're told  
But I never felt the itch  
I never would  
  
My mother had forbidden me  
To waste away my life  
I want you to have all the things  
I could never buy you  
So don't stop what I'd begun  
You're my one and only son  
Follow what I say, not what I've done  
Follow what I say, not what I've done  
  
Shower, scrub, and shave  
Cleanly boys don't misbehave  
  
Follow what I say, not what I've done

"260","Christina Aguilera","Remember","I remember that time when I first laid eyes on you  
I looked into your eyes and I knew all my dreams would come true  
With you  
Then you left last summer and rest of your family  
And you left me here all alone for the rest of eternity  
  
Chores  
It's not easy to move on and it's certainly not easy to  
Be as stong as you'd like to be  
Because you left me here with only one memory  
  
How could ya do it how could ya leave knowing what you've done  
How could stand blaming for what I have done  
What I have done  
  
It was a cold night and I was at home crying over you my  
Friends were there to calm me and I got up and I jumped  
Over the balcony  
  
I......  
I blame you my.... My friends do to  
It was all.... All because of you  
Because you left me to find someone new

"261","Utopia","Welcome To My Revolution","There's too much music, too much light  
These endless broadcasts into the night  
Petty seizures of money and drugs  
By some official or unauthorized thugs  
Now it's gone, the whole world's gone  
There's the army at the front door, guerrillas in back  
Why do I always have to take up sides  
I had no plans to be conscripted today  
I am no use to them anyway  
So what the hell's going on  
When they took my bed for the good of the state  
I had to rest my head and took to levitation  
Welcome to my revolution  
Every morning they confer with the press  
Just to point a few fingers  
Fix the blame for this mess  
The spokesmen waffle and the jerk-offs complain  
In a stream of rhetoric  
Piss themselves down the drain  
Then it's time to go home  
Time to go home  
What will they say when it's gone  
The whole world's gone  
So they call a cease fire to bury the dead  
And just delay it for an hour or so  
Loose talk of cowards and leaders that lied  
What does it matter once we're vaporized  
Say what the hell's going on  
Then it got so bad I couldn't breathe the air  
So I became my own church and begged for sanctuary  
Welcome to my revolution  
This is the dream that I have every night  
I wake up screaming t  
Is this my vision of the end of the world  
The faces looked smoldered, the edges are curled  
Tell me what is the reason we can't look at ourselves  
And realize everybody creates his own hell  
And if we put it together to make them all real  
And then forget how to think, forget how to feel  
Until it's gone, the whole world's gone  
Are we damned if we do and damned if we don't  
Could we be suckered into thinking that  
Or get too greedy, afraid of the loss  
And wind up fighting for a worthless cause  
What if we died and had to come back  
How may times would we have to go 'round  
What if tomorrow was the end of the line  
Don't want to feel like I wasted my time  
So what the hell's going on  
When the noise gets so dense  
you can't hear yourself think  
We got the spirit world on a telephone link  
So welcome to my revolution

To hear my plea  
And take care of me

Where can I be safe  
Where can I belong

Of sadness  
How can I forget  
Those beautiful dreams that we shared  
They're lost and they're nowhere to be found  
How can I go on

Sometimes I start to crawl  
But in my eyes  
I cannot see  
When people fly by me  
I hide myself down near the ground  
Is anybody there  
To look for me

La-da-da-da-da precious love  
Hear my plea-yeah!

And started a fire.  
Had the radio playing  
From inside the car  
I took off my shirt  
And kicked off my shoes

And told me the news  
She said, ""There's a lot of people out there""  
""Who are at the end of their rope""  
""Sometimes, baby you've got to lay low""

We both get us some real  
Good suntans  
I thought, that was OK  
Sometimes life can be so grand  
  
We were getting' ready  
To shake out that place  
When the Illinois state trooper  
Got in my face

But once he cooled down, he was OK  
Sometimes you're golden, man

A hound of hell and the devil don't care  
  
[Chorus]  
Running silent, running deep, we are your final prayer  
Warriors in secret sleep, a merchantman's nightmare  
A silent death lies awaiting, for all of you below  
Running silent, running deep, sink into your silent sleep  
  
Chill the hearts of fighting men  
In open ocean wondering when?  
The lethal silver fish will fly  
The boat will shiver-men will die  
A cast of millions-a part to play  
Killer victim or fool for a day  
Obeying an order-men have to die  
Us or them-a well rehearsed lie  
  
[Chorus]  
  
The lifeboats shattered the hull is torn  
The tar black smell of burning oil  
On the way down to Davy Jones  
Every man for himself-you're on your own  
The wolf eyes watch the cross wire  
'stern tubes ready', 'aim and fire

She left her sock in my dryer  
I met a woman in a yellow cap  
It said brimstone and fire  
I said is this luck? With just a glance  
She smiled, and I thought, is this a sign ?  
From above or below? Oh no...brimstone...  
Brimstone and fire...  
  
The next week at the cinema  
She pur her hand on my shoulder  
She almost kissed me walking home  
And I didn't even scold her  
Then I said where is this leading with just a heavy sigh  
I quickened my pace and she was following  
As if her heart would never tire  
Brimstone and fire, brimstone and fire...  
  
Now we have dinner every Saturday  
I make spaghetti, she brings cake  
I make spaghetti with tomato sauce,  
Because that's all I can make  
And when she lights the candles  
I think, here we go...  
But it's so pleasant after all  
And I say very low  
Don't forget to light the fire

Raise their hopes so sad and sunken  
Slash them up as they lie there drunken  
Push them down into the foul mud

Oh like an expensive suite at the best hotel

You wanna know how I feel, just like that, just like that (Oh)  
  
Oh like a great blue sky's on a summer day  
Oh like sitting close in a small cafe  
Oh like making love to someone you love  
Oh like breaking up then making up  
Oh like a warm embrace when you come around  
Oh like the sweetest words when your feeling down  
Oh like lost inside of a mascaraed  
Oh like a celebration in a big parade  
Oh like a secret told to the one you trust  
Oh like kissing you in a all white tux  
  
You wanna know how I feel, just like that, just like that baby (If you wanna

You wanna know how I feel, just like that, just like that baby (Just like

You wanna know how I feel, just like that, just like that baby (Just like

"298","Diana Ross","He's All I Got","You're a girl that hates to see others happy  
Unless you're happy too  
So you've told the boy I love  
A lot of things that ain't true  
  
And it's wringing my heart  
Cause it's making us drift apart  
So humbly I ask of you  
To undo the wrong that you've done  
  
Please go to him, tell him  
Before he finds someone new  
Cause if I ever lose him  
I don't know what I'll do  
  
Cause he's all I got  
Built my world around him  
Since the day I found him  
  
Girl, your selfishness causes unhappiness  
But why make it hard for me?  
Since you been unhappy in love  
I guess misery loves company  
  
For once in your life  
Consider another's feelings  
Confess the truth  
That you've been concealing  
  
Please go to him, tell him  
Before he finds someone new  
Cause if I ever lose him  
I don't know what I'll do  
  
Cause he's all I got  
Built my world around him  
Since the day found him  
  
I would gladly go to him  
Instead of asking you  
But there might be a shadow of a doubt  
Your gossip might have been true  
  
So tearfully I ask of you  
Please undo the wrong that you've done  
Cause without his love  
I know, I know I can't go on  
  
Please go to him, tell him  
Before he finds someone new  
Cause if I ever lose him  
I don't know what I'll do  
  
Cause he's all I got  
Built my world around him  
Since the day found him  
Can't bear to lose him

Singin' some sad song

Understand, hold my hand  
Time is never gonna stop runnin'  
Never gonna stop  
Take me to the top of the trees  
Don't take me for a cracked window pane  
Bad news and tunes  
Are shinin' from the high  
Singin' some sad song  
Don't rehearse, this is the last verse  
In the hearse, goin' through your purse  
And if they would ever laugh, not here  
They would ever laugh  
Blame it on my style, once again  
Don't take me for a ride in the rain

Generations and now I'm all grown up and you carry my seed  
Now we are flesh and blood  
With you I am in love  
For the rest of my life  
For the rest of my life  
We've been blessed with a love that's rare  
That's why I'm not going nowhere

He says to ""be cool"" but, I don't know how yet, wind in my hair,  
Hand on the back of my neck

Winin' and dinin', drinkin' and drivin', excessive buyin',  
Overdose and dyin' on our drugs and our love and our dreams and our rage  
Blurrin' the lines between real and the fake  
God can only, I need somebody to hold me

Keep me safe in his bell, tower, hotel  
  
Money is the anthem of success  
So put on mascara, and your party dress  
  
I'm your National Anthem, boy put your hands up, give me a standing ovation,  
Boy you have landed, babe in the land of, sweetness and danger, Queen of
Saigon

Maybe I'm desperate for a reason to believe  
There wasn't any way I thought that we would fall.  
I've seen perfection in a rainbow in the sky  
I've seen a child make the coldest grown man cry  
But loving you I thought was greater than them all.

Will we live forever for a moment we can keep?

Won't you look down upon me, Jesus

You've just got to see me through another day  
My body's aching and my time is at hand  
And I won't make it any other way

Lord knows when the cold wind blows it'll turn you head around  
Well, there's hours of time on the telephone line to talk about things to come  
Sweet dreams and flying machines in pieces on the ground

Oh Lord I stand amazed at the wonder of it all  
And yet a greater wonder brings me to my knees

Lord I praise you, because of who you are  
Not for all the mighty deeds that you have done  
Lord I worship you, because of who you are  
It's all the reason that I need to voice my praise  
Because of who you are  
  
One holy night you sent your promise from a virgin  
And promise grew as you revealed to us your heart  
Enduring love displayed through out your crucifixion  
And in your death, you tore the darkened grave apart

The Queen of my heart  
  
So lets take tonight, and never let go  
While we dance we kiss, like there's no tomorrow,  
As the stars sparkle down, like a diamond ring,  
I'll treasure this moment, till we meet again

Looking at money man,  
Diggin' the deadly quotas,  
Out of balance,  
Out of hand  
We want the land!  
Lay down the reeking ore!  
Don't you hear the shrieking in the trees?  
Everywhere you touch the earth, she's sore  
Every time you skin her all things weep  
Your money mocks us  
Restitution, what good can it do?  
Kenneled in metered boxes  
Red dogs in debt to you  
  
I am Lakota!  
Lakota!  
Fighting among ourselves  
All we can say with one whole heart  
Is we won't sell,  
No we'll never sell  
We want the land!  
The lonely coyote calls  
In the woodlands, footprints of the deer  
In the barrooms, poor drunk bastard falls  
In the courtrooms, deaf ears, sixty years  
You think we're sleeping--but  
Quietly like rattlesnakes and stars  
We have seen the trampled rainbows  
In the smoke of cars

Sun pity me  
I am Lakota

Moon pity me

Oh pity me  
I am Lakota  
Weak  
Grass pity me  
I am Lakota  
Faithful  
Rocks pity me  
I am Lakota  
Meek  
Standing water

Oh pity me  
  
I am Lakota!  
Lakota!  
Standing on sacred land  
We never sold these Black Hills  
To the missile-heads,  
To the power plants  
We want the land!  
The bullet and the fence, broke Lakota  
The black coats and the booze, broke Lakota  
Courts that circumvent, choke Lakota  
Nothing left to lose  
Tell me grandfather  
You spoke the fur and feather tongues,  
Do you hear the whimpering waters  
When the tractors come?

And I carried your books 'cause even then I was a fool  
But you grew up and said goodbye  
I still remember the things that made me cry  
  
For all too soon my story ends  
I found a love, now not even friends  
Tell me why  
Loving you , loving me like you used to do  
I was the child  
  
I held your hand and I told you things  
And I made you believe, believe in fairy tales  
And diamond rings  
  
Hen all too soon my story ends  
I found a love ,now not even friends  
Tell me why  
Loving you , loving me like you used to do  
I was the child  
Ah...

"356","Dolly Parton","Evening Shade","(Dolly Parton)  
My train of thought was broken by a sudden burst of laughter  
Something badly needed to brighten up the chores  
Seemed old Mrs. Bailey had accidentally fell  
In the water being used to scrub the floors  
Now Mrs. Bailey was the meanest matron at the home  
She believed in lots of work with little play  
And we laughed till we bent double  
Though we knew we'd get in trouble  
But trouble's all we had at evening shade  
Now evening shade was where they claim to teach you understanding  
To teach you love and keep you off the streets  
And all the kids that live here are said to be a problem  
Juvenile delinquents so to speak  
But understanding isn't learned from punishment and anger  
An iron has no gentle touch and love ain't learned from hate  
The reason we were here is 'cause we had no one who cared  
But they cared even less at evening shade  
Little Susan Bradley, one night had wet her bed  
Mrs. Bailey took the razor strap and beat her half to death  
And I knew that something must be done to put an end to this  
And so I started talking plans with the older kids  
Plans were that Joe Johnson would steal the kerosene  
And I would get some matches when nobody seen  
Beckie Adams would make sure the kids were all outside  
Billy Watson would look out for the evil eye  
Now Mrs. Bailey took a nap at three o'clock each day  
We knew that she'd be a'sleeping as the plans got underway  
Now that its all over and the sun is going down  
There's no evening shade 'cause we burned it to the ground

Defenses down and you got me shakin'  
You got me so that my nerves are breakin'  
If you knew me like I know you girl  
Your knees would bend and your hair would curl  
You make me move yea like no one else  
Cause when I'm with you I can't control myself  
  
I've got this feeling that's inside of me  
It makes me think of how things used to be  
It makes me feel alright  
When I'm with you at night and we love  
And we love  
  
You thrill me so with this big temptation  
This kind of feelin' could move a nation  
And I'm okay when I'm here with you  
I do the things that you want me to  
I do these things for no one else 'cause when I'm with you I can't control

Half the truth is of no use  
Give it all, give it all to me

Give me the full moon  
And if I can't take the whole of you  
Give it to me anyway  
Give me all night  
'Till the last star fades  
And if you can't take my heart and soul  
Take it from me anyway  
  
Don't give me fountains, I need waterfalls  
And, when I cry my tears'll fill an ocean  
The pain of love I'll accept it all  
As long as you'll join me in that emotion  
Half of lovin' is no fun  
Give it all, give it all to me

Don't walk me half the way home

Or Baton Rouge down in Louisiana  
I might make it up to Detroit City  
Where people work hard and life is gritty  
It don't really matter where I am

This old world has been good to me  
So I try to give back and I want to be free  
  
I was born in Ontario  
I was born in Ontario (Ontario)  
Ontario, I was born in Ontario (Ontario) Ontario  
  
I still like to sing a happy song  
Once in a while when things go wrong  
I might pick up a pen, scribble on a page  
Try to make sense of my inner rage  
One cold winter we went down south  
With daddy's typewriter for a couple of months  
  
But I was born in Ontario (Ontario)  
I was born in Ontario (Ontario)  
Ontario, I was born in Ontario (Ontario) Ontario  
  
I was born in Ontario  
Where the black fly bites  
And the green grass grows  
That's where I learned most of what I know  
'Cause you don't learn much when you start to get old  
I left home at a tender young age  
Mom and daddy never liked to stay  
In any one place for very long  
We just kept moving, moving on  
  
But I was born in Ontario (Ontario)  
I was born in Ontario (Ontario)  
Ontario, I was born in Ontario (Ontario) Ontario

And did you hear the  
Music of their laughter  
As they set about to play?  
And did you smell the  
Fragrance of those roses  
In your garden?  
Did the morning sunlight  
Warm your soul and  
Brighten up your day?

Alive or is the limit

Precious time and health.  
Placing values on the

Deal the best of them  
And steal it from the rest of them.

Brought you to the top  
Where the smiles are all synthetic  
And the ulcers never stop  
When they take that final inventory  
Yours will be the same  
Sad story everywhere -  
No one will really care. no one more lonely than  
This rich important man.

ENDORSE your epitaph!

Then one day she found a TV preacher she adored

Then some kid who worked in Harley's factory he got himself this big idea  
Figured out how to do it with compures drove Harley out of business in a

I couldn't catch my breath  
Is it too late to call this off  
  
We could slip away, wouldn't that be better  
Me with nothing to say, and you in your autumn sweater  
  
I tried my best to hide  
In a crowded room, it's nearly possible  
I wait for you, oh, most patiently  
  
So I looked for your eyes  
And the waves looked like they'd pour right out of them  
I'll try hard, I'll try always  
But it's a waste of time  
It's a waste of time if I can't smile easily  
Like in the beginning

Over the last crumbling mountain  
And the last lion roars  
At the last dusty fountain  
In the shadow of the forest

They will stare unbelieving  
At the Last Unicorn  
When the first breath of winter  
Throught the flowers is icing  
And you look to the north  
And a pale moon is rising  
And it seems like all is dying  
And would leave the world to mourn  
In the distance hear her laughter  
It's the Last Unicorn  
I'm alive....... I'm alive  
When the last moon is cast  
Over the last star of morning  
And the future has past  
Without even a last desparate warning  
Then look into the sky where through  
The cloudes a path is formed  
Look and see her how she sparkles  
It's the Last Unicorn  
I'm alive... I'm alive.

What goes round must come around your way  
There's a new fool somewhere waiting  
For your old fashion heartbreak love affair  
She'll see through your intentions  
With each lie that you tell  
And the old ways will go out with the new some way

To a faraway place

We made magic that night. Oh, he did everything right  
He brought the woman out of me, so many times, easily  
And in the morning when he woke all I left him was a note  
I told him I am the flower you are the seed  
We walked in the garden we planted a tree  
Don't try to find me, please don't you dare  
Just live in my memory, you'll always be there

We made love  
  
Then it happened one day, we came round the same way  
You can imagine his surprise when he saw his own eyes  
I said please, please understand

was the one little thing that you can

Is your money that good?  
Will it buy you forgiveness?  
Do you think that it would?  
Oh, I think you will find  
When your death takes its toll  
All the money you made will never buy back your soul  
And I hope that you die  
And your death will come soon  
I'll stand on your [Incomprehensible]  
In the pale afternoon  
And I'll watch while you're lowered  
Into your deathbed  
And I'll stand on your grave till I'm sure that you're dead

Wrong sign  
Cast out'a the wrong mold  
Sorry is no way that I feel  
Cast out'a the wrong mold  
Singin' my blues is for real  
But it's so hard to see the light  
When you're born under the wrong sign  
  
Born under the wrong sign  
Trouble is my middle name  
Born under the wrong  
Every day turns out the same  
But it's so hard to see the light  
When you're born under the wrong sign  
Wrong sign  
Wrong sign

Out of luck  
Thought I was just dreamin  
Then I woke up  
You said it was over  
The end of the line  
I'm telling everybody I'm fine  
But I'm just  
  
Climbing up mount everest  
I swear it's like  
Crawling from here to Memphis  
Knocked senseless, like  
Digging a hole to china to find  
You don't love me anymore  
  
Night after night  
I come home  
Watch it on the news who else was overthrown  
I don't understand it  
As hard as I try  
But I keep crossing over the great divide  
And it's like  
  
Climbing up mount everest  
I swear it's like  
Crawling from here to Memphis  
Knocked senseless, like  
Digging a hole to china to find  
You don't love me anymore  
  
Shine the light  
Ring the bell  
I guess you don't love me  
Well, well  
I'll go on  
I'll survive  
I don't know how but I'll try

"416","Neil Young","Days That Used To Be","People say don't rock the boat,  
Let things go their own way  
Ideas that once seem so right,  
Now have gotten hard to say  
I wish I could talk to you,  
You could talk to me  
'Cause there's very few of us left  
My friend  
From the days that used to be.  
  
Seem like such a simple thing  
To follow one's own dream  
But possessions and concession  
Are not often what they seem  
They drag you down  
And load you down  
In disguise of security.  
But we never had  
To make those deals  
In the days that used to be.  
  
Talk to me, my long lost friend,  
Tell me how you are  
Are you happy with  
Your circumstance,  
Are you driving a new car  
Does it get you where you wanna go,  
With a seven year warranty  
Or just another  
Hundred thousand miles away  
From days that used to be.

"417","Jason Mraz","After An Afternoon","I bare my windowed self untamed and untrained  
Dreams that hardly touch our complexions truest faults  
If room enough for both my drowsy spirit shall fall  
Bold waves tumble to the season of my heart  
Where you have offered my faith and my trust  
Until all is lost into the beauty of the day.  
  
But there is something in the way you laugh  
That makes me feel like a child  
Aspects of life they confuse me  
You and your thesis amuse me.  
  
After an afternoon with you  
And your rich brown eyes  
Your lips and your dark hair  
Elbows and exposed knees tossing toward the ceiling  
After an afternoon.  
  
Face to palm  
Tear to tear  
Mouth to tongue  
Heart to ground  
I am in love.

Some will feel like you can't find your way

I've seen many a life gone astray  
When someone goes  
All your bows won't make it any better so let it go  
  
[Chorus]  
Shut up and take it like a man  
You need us to get a life  
For your own good we'll take you by the hand  
'Cause you need a little more  
  
Maybe no one will say it  
Maybe no one's aware it goes on  
All I know  
All I know it's like going off the deep end  
Could you make a decision?  
Could you think for yourself and go on?  
Everyone knows  
Everyone knows you've got to fit into the mainstream so save your woes  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Close your eyes  
Look away now  
Make believe while you can  
So you'd best go along  
Don't let on if you can't find your way  
Many more  
Many more do it for you  
Because heaven knows  
Heaven knows it's like playing with fire  
Your life's a throw

If you can't tell lies,

I'm dropping bolts on the ground and I'm coming unwound  
  
Don't you miss the good old days,  
When I let you misbehave?  
Why you're looking down like that?  
I know that you dying to come back,

Placed on trial  
To hide in shrouded alley silhouettes  
With cigarette coiled  
To strike at passing voices

I refuse to wear a bar code across my chest  
I refuse to let a black tee or throwback jersey define me  
I refuse to let my children witness divorce  
Or make mature decisions in court  
I refuse to grow up carrying the generational curse  
I refuse to feel the need to curse in my verse  
I hate being automatically looked at when someone asks can anyone rap  
I wanna be a black man that can flip it from urban to corporate measures  
A black man who doesn't gain knowledge from the world for his own pleasures  
A black man who reps Christ to the fullest with no regrets  
My only regret is the stigma that many black statistics in the past have set  
Like going to jail, bragging about bail, leaving our kids, cussing at church,  
Married and you still flirt, no father present at birth  
Animosity within the ministers of our church  
I refuse to let my people be viewed as temporary  
I plan on planting a seed not for the moment but for one that's legendary  
As for statistics  
My father broke the mode  
And I feel its my job for the next generation to continue in it  
Because I refuse to be another black statistic

"435","Megadeth","My Kingdom","The flag that I once planted as a king I abandoned  
And now I reclaim this banner by God my sword and my name  
In a truce sealed by blood within this metal skin and all that I own  
Blood, bone, and courage in my veins and the heart that pumps it  
  
Drink from the chalice and be reborn  
And the land with me, it will change and transform  
  
A fighting man sworn to the quest it is the doom of man that they forget  
I have awoken the dragon and all around me the mist of his breath  
Good and evil, there never is one without the other, his brother  
Always there where I least expect it, it will burn me to cinders  
  
The futures taken root in the present son  
Don't look into my heart, least of all your own  
  
No man who is false can win in combat against the truth  
When he lies he murders some part of the world, we must find what was lost  
Hearth and home, wife and child were not for me, I was not yet done  
I never knew how empty my soul was until it was refilled  
  
Mad distemper strikes both beggars and Kings  
The Necromancer's hard teachings of war and quest  
  
I am given the right to bear arms and power to meet justice  
I have lived through others for far too long,  
And carried my guilt, my causes, my sins  
I hope in the hereafter when I owe no more to the future  
That I can be just a man

Fall out of bed and catch a fading star  
Fancy I woke up before my alarm  
Brought my mind through my eyes  
It's the best I can do  
Before it's automatic, hand it over, turn it to you  
Though her smile when it happens, almost as if it was magic  
It means there's a god somewhere and he's laughing  
And I shuffle my slipperless toes to the kitchen  
Still low to the ground, but high on living  
Chorus  
And I know, I know, it's gonna be a good day  
Hello, hello, you beautiful thing  
Verse  
Waking up and stretch my body  
And acknowledge the makes  
It must be something I did yesterday  
Pour a cup of liquid gold  
'Cause my engine's still cold  
And in a minute everything's gonna change  
Chorus  
'Cause I know, I know, it's gonna be a good day  
Hello, hello, you beautiful thing  
Yes I know, I know, it's gonna be a good day  
Hello, hello, you beautiful thing

Verse  
Looking out from a... [?] watching the band of the  
Earth take the plaque of the night from the dirt  
I can see from the depths of my readjustinize of reflection  
Of yes's and that ever changing sky  
But why do bad dreams linger long after I awake?  
I don't need no scenes of valid paying replayed (??)  
And I feel quite foolish sometimes when I pray  
But my thoughts are all I've got so I try to make them brave

Oh you want to hear a story? What kind of story you want to hear baby?  
Willow  
A scary story  
[VERSE 1]  
Oh, ok  
Once upon a time there was a kid who wanted nothin' more than to rhyme  
Almost like he was born in the rhyme  
He thought of his rhymes almost all of the time  
And he fought with his mom  
His school getting caught with his rhyme book  
And he knew he shouldn't of took it there in the first place  
At least he shouldn't of been sittin lookin there in her face with it  
Teacher told him get it out of her class  
Wicked witch, trick told him that's probably why you won't pass  
Now if you shy you won't last but you're new  
So underneath his breath before he left he said I'm a be richer then you  
What you say? She said.  
What you mean? He said.  
Boy don't you play, she said.  
What you mean? He said. Damnit.  
Ten minutes later standin up in the principles office  
Getting handed the phone clammed up cause his father was talking  
And he was pissed he wasn't listening to his son.  
You testing me? You messin up again  
You done boy.  
[CHORUS]  
This is just a story about a young man comin up in the rap game  
A real scary story  
Went from rags to riches it has goblins in it haters and witches. Uh.  
  
[REPEAT CHORUS]  
  
[VERSE 2]  
First thing he did was find somebody to give him some money.  
He wasn't stupid but wasn't using his senses honey.  
The guy's he meant was a little shady, a little funny.  
But they gave him the money so they played the record company.  
It sounds silly but when he grew up in Philly rhymin wasn't what it is today  
Deals wasn't a dime a dozen  
Today every sister, uncle, or mom or cousin gotta record deal  
But for real it wasn't like that then.  
As you could imagine when he started risin to fame and fortune he was  
havin Started antagonizing the guy's he was with  
At the same time he started realizing  
The deal he got from them guys in his eyes didn't fly with size of his hits  
He called a meeting to find a solution.  
He said I'm gettin beat out of my loot  
And I'm not recording no more until we find a solution  
The dude's said we found a solution its this .44  
He ran for the door a little shaken  
But the next day he found a lawyer, told him the situation  
He said I'm breakin this contract for ya  
He said how much the lawyer said I'm a charge you a quarter cause I like you  
Just do me a favor  
get your life in order

I don't need saving  
I don't need lies  
  
I don't believe  
In the angel wars (Oh Lord)  
I don't believe  
In the virgin birth (Father)  
I don't believe  
In the cross on the hill (Jesus)  
I don't believe  
In the kindness of God to man  
  
I'll drive a stake  
Through the black of your heart (Oh Lord)  
I'll pull down your temples  
And burn every word (Father)  
I'll kill all the angels  
That show me 'The Light' (Jesus)  
I'll drift into darkness  
And tear out the soul of God

Comes from countries ending in  
Where the family name is Khan

The answer, they say  
Is to bomb them all to dust  
Then in fifty years they just  
Might be able to see things our way  
  
We're not barbarians  
Like we were way back when  
We've learned from history  
So we're going round again  
  
I miss the days  
When the threat to our position  
Didn't come from some religion  
But from godless communism

You wear your hair just right

You get so macho when you're with your bitch

And the Tallulah Bankhead and Canada Lee  
Somewhere far-off, peaceful, sleeping they learned to love sleep  
At the Dire Wolf's crest the Newfoundland paused  
Desolate's best was gotten across  
We were never more here, expanse getting broader

At the Dire Wolf's best the Newfoundland paused  
So desperate as to be a lost cause

So take some good advice from me  
Just try it once before you ask

I don't like the other choice  
(Live it up, live it up)

And who will be the last to laugh  
Here's another lame excuse  
You're old enough to be her dad  
I've heard all the reasons why  
(Give it up, give it up, take a powder)  
I turn them my blindest eye  
(Give it up, give it up)

And any way they want to  
Life goes by, done before you start

The blood that I so crave  
The last thing that you see  
Is the hunger in my eyes

Blood sucking creatures of the night  
Nocturnal spectre hiding from the light  
Cries screaming out every fright  
Eagerly awaiting plight  
Apparitions from the pits of Hell  
Death plagues the streets in which they dwell  
Demented lust, the secrets they must keep  
Addicted to your blood  
At dawn they sleep  
  
Unveil the hidden coffin  
Lift the lid of terror  
Feel the deadly cold  
Freeze you from inside  
  
Perceiving your intentions  
To slay the phantom form  
Raise the stake in malice  
You cannot plunge it down

To lie dormant  
Is certain Death

Implanted along the brain of the sickening parasite  
Linked together by one trait  
The Hell-filled need to kill, kill, kill, kill, kill)  
  
Emerging from their Hellish tomb  
Taking flight amidst the night  
The evening skies are raining Death  
  
Swooping down from shadowed skies  
Taking simple human form  
Shed their wings to stalk the mortal man  
  
Lock their jaws into your veins  
Satanic soldiers strike their prey  
Leaving corpses waiting for the change  
  
Blood dripping from the jaws of Death  
Not enough to satisfy  
They must drain your soul of life

"488","George Jones","A Place In The Country","For thirty some odd years he faced a grinder in the city,  
Hustlin' day in day out just tryin' to survive,  
He bought his wife the finer things,and sent his kids to collage,  
That always took what little bit he tried to put aside,  
  
But through it all he had one thing that seemed to keep him going,  
A dream that someday he could leave this city life behind,  
I watched his hair turn thin and gray, but his dream never faded,  
He told me all about it at least a thousand times.  
  
[Chorus]  
He always wanted, a place out in the country,  
Where the birds sing, in the morning,and the grass is emerald green,  
A place where, he could feel the mornin' sunshine,  
And sit out in the evenin', where the air is, fresh and clean.  
  
It took lots of overtime to keep his wife up with the jonses,  
And more to get his son out of his run-ins with the law,  
The more it took the more he gave, never once complaining,  
I don't know how he ever stood the pressure of it all.  
  
I never thought he'd make it, but he finally left the city,  
And now he's got that special little place to call his own,  
Today I took a ride out in the country just to see him,  
It wasn't hard to find because his name was on the stone.

"490","Glen Campbell","I'm So Lonesome I Could Cry","Hear that lonesome whippoorwill he sounds too blue to fly  
That midnight train is whining low I'm so lonesome I could cry  
Did you ever see a night so long when time goes crawling by  
The moon just went behind a cloud to hide its face and cry  
  
Did you ever see a robin weep when leaves began to die  
It means he's lost the will to live I'm so lonesome I could cry  
The silence of a falling star lights up a purple sky  
And as I wonder where you are I'm so lonesome I could cry

Full of emptiness

And memories of him

That makes me tend to leave my sleepin' bag rolled up  
Stashed behind your couch  
And it's knowin' I'm not shackled by forgotten words and bonds  
And the ink stains that have dried upon some lines  
That keeps you in the back roads  
By the rivers of my memory and keeps you ever gentle on my mind  
It's not clingin' to the rocks and ivy  
Planted on their columns now that bind me  
Or somethin' that somebody said 'cause  
They thought we fit together walkin'  
It's just knowin' that the world will not be cursin' or forgivin'  
When I walk along some railroad track and find  
That you're movin' on the back roads  
By the rivers of my memory and for hours you're just gentle on my mind  
Though the wheat fields and the coal mines and the junkyards  
And the highways come between us  
And some other woman's cryin' to her mother  
'Cause she turned and I was gone  
I still might run in silence tears of joy might stain my face  
And the summer sun might burn me till I'm blind  
But not to where I cannot see  
You walkin' on the back roads by the rivers flowin' gentle on my mind  
I dip my cup of soup  
From some gurglin', cracklin' cauldron in some train yard  
My beard a roughenin' coal pile  
And a dirty hat pulled low across my face  
Through cupped hands 'round a tin can  
I pretend to hold you to my breast and find  
That you're wavin' from the back roads  
By the rivers of my memory ever smilin', ever gentle on my mind

Break my mind break my mind oh Lord

Oh baby oh baby let me keep your suitcase off of the scales in time  
Tell the man that you've suddenly developed a thing about flyin'

"508","Nick Drake","Joey In Mind","When joey first came the light seemed to rise  
Thought it came in the night and left with her eyes  
And I wish that her face would return once again  
Just one day to remind me of saturday's gain.  
  
As I sit in her city in fog and in steam  
Everything's blurred, for blurred is my dream  
So I'll leave for my terrace and tea laced with rum  
And wait for the day when joey will come.  
  
And come all the dreams that never did try  
To live on a memory or float on a sigh  
Together we'll sit in the saturday rain  
And dream of joey or mary jane.

Oh and just like the river I've been running ever since  
It's been a long, a long time coming

It's been too hard living but I'm afraid to die  
'Cause I don't know what's up there beyond the sky  
It's been a long, a long time coming  
But I know a change gonna come, oh yes it will  
  
I go to the movie and I go downtown  
Somebody keep telling me, ""Don't hang around""  
It's been a long, a long time coming  
But I know a change gonna come, oh yes it will  
  
Then I go to my brother  
And I say, ""Brother, help me please""  
But he winds up knockin' me  
Back down on my knees  
  
Oh there been times that I thought I couldn't last for long  
But now I think I'm able to carry on  
It's been a long, a long time coming  
But I know a change gonna come, oh yes it will

I know it's not just an alibi  
Now I hear things that are better kept under the hat  
Who backs it up?  
Look at your hand, you can count on that  
When you talk, it's hard to disagree  
And when you dance, you're talking to me  
When you stand, you stand for something  
Stand for something  
They can't dim your flame  
When you stand, you stand for something  
Stand for something  
They can't bend your stream  
Here I stand  
Outside the world of political  
I would not lose that  
For all the gold in South Africa  
What you wear did not come easy  
What you hear sounds different to me  
When you stand, you're standing next to me  
You put your foot down every day  
Make sure you bring it down on the up beat  
So walk away those feet of clay  
We are fighting and dancing in the street

Trying hard to leave the load  
We take it there but we can't let go  
It's so hard to lay it down  
  
Back in Eden we were tried  
Found ourselves dissatisfied  
Seeking wisdom that she denied  
Trying hard to lay it down  
  
Lay it down, brother,lay it down  
It's so hard to lay it down  
  
Hide in me,confide in me  
Don't you think it's time to be  
Everything we tried to be  
You and me should lay it down  
  
Speak to me, be unashamed  
There's no time for playing games  
After all we're all the same  
Just trying hard to lay it down  
  
Lay it down, brother,lay it down  
It's so hard to lay it down  
  
Lay it down, brother,lay it down  
It's so hard to lay it down  
  
Wish my words could make it well  
Wish that I might break the shell  
Take us from our self-made well  
Find a way to lay it down  
  
Burdened by the things I've learned  
Hurting cause I'm too concerned  
Nonetheless I confess I yearn  
To find a way to lay it down  
  
Lay it down, lay it down  
It's so hard to lay it down  
  
Lay it down, lay it down  
It's so hard to lay it down  
  
Lay it down, lay it down  
It's so hard... to lay it... down

My, how the boys roam, from roaming,  
Loc and come home, to homes of his own  
No catching up he's in a whole 'nother zone  
Still true to his roots, stay close to the chrome  
  
Haters stay clear of him, y'all stand cheer for him  
Got up out the game and overcame, let's hear it for him  
Keep a new toy, so, I wonder how could  
I not enjoy life, I'm re-living my childhood  
  
Big chain monsta, whip game bonkas  
Monster truck remind him of Tonka  
Diamond F color, plush gold still gutter  
My dealer's in the mills motherfuck' and I ain't studder

The he who holds O's like Krispy Kreme's oven  
Or easy bake, pink divvies make  
The presidential should look like strawberry shortcake, P

Uh, you niggas is clones

And if you owe me and if I decided to take it back  
  
It wasn't nicely expect Rosco to put you back, in place  
I'm what you call a destructive warpath  
It'll be a shell shower in today's forecast  
You a gangsta? I can't tell  
  
You diamonds don't glimmer when the light hit it  
Those jewels aren't genuine, 'cause if they was I'm nice with it  
I woulda' been took that  
That skinny stack in your pocket, I woulda' been shook that  
  
In this world you gotta watch it, I'm hear to warn ya  
Cats turned informant, over snow wrapped in wax  
My son's home crying, don't give me no slack  
Just put the motherfucking money in the bag  
  
These words are being said as I hide behind glove and mask  
Coat change not your typical crook

Oh maiden, fair maiden, 'tis time to give o'er.  
Oh no, kind soldier, please play one tune more

Than to see the waters glide and hear the nightingale sing.

Two wives and the army's too many for me.  
  
Well, I'll go back to London and I'll stay there for a year,  
It's often that I'll think of you, my little dear.  
And if ever I return it will be in the spring

When you feel it go and throw it right back  
Just let me hold ya by ya shoulders  
Then you can take it like that  
I knew you was a champ girl got your leg  
On the dresser kickin' the lamp girl  
Run the shower lets go in the bathroom girl  
Cause the temperature is hotter than high noon girl  
Crack that door let the steam flow  
Ain't nobody here but me and you let it go  
You never it this good you already know  
Give me all you got girl really though

You're the sexiest woman I've ever known  
My mind is blown  
You're simple beautiful how you do it to me  
You're showin' me things id never do  
Whole 'nother side of you  
Just keep what you do it feels like oh we  
  
You can go ahead and hit a wild climax  
Ain't no way I'm bout to let you relax let me see if  
You can hold me on ya back  
Let me see ya body wine to the track  
Chop it a little bit  
Hard to read you it feels like I'm illiterate  
But I'm ready for the graduation  
Yeah go ahead and repeat that rotation

Cold blows the drops of rain

I'll sit and weep down by his grave for twelve month and one day  
  
But when twelve months were come and gone  
This young man he arose  
What makes you weep down by my grave  
I can't take my repose  
  
One kiss, one kiss of your lily white lips, one kiss is all I crave  
One kiss, one kiss of your lily white lips and return back to your grave  
  
My lips they are as cold as my clay  
My breath is heavy and strong  
If thou was to kiss my lily white lips  
Thy days would not be long  
  
Oh don't you remember the garden grove where we used to walk  
Pluck the finest flower of them all, twill wither to a stalk  
  
Go fetch me a nun from the dungeon deep  
And water from a stone  
And white milk from a maiden's breast,  
That babe ere never known  
  
Go dig me a grave both long, wide and deep as quickly as you may  
I'll lie down in it and take one sleep for twelve month and one day  
  
Cold blows the wind over my true love  
Cold blows the drops of rain

Lost inside myself  
With the world surrounding me  
Wandering through the misery  
But now I am free  
  
You gave me a breath of life  
Unclouded my eyes  
With sweet serenity  
Lighting a ray of hope for me  
And now I am free  
  
Free to live  
Free to laugh  
Free to soar  
Free to shine  
Free to give  
Free to love  
Free enough to fly  
  
Once I was all so alone  
Unsteady and cold  
But your love rained down upon me  
Washing away uncertainty  
  
But now  
I am free

'Cause what you got, that'll make you lose  
And then turn around and step in your shoes  
I say they'll turn around  
And step in your shoes  
  
I stood there, numb  
Watchin' my friend walk away

On top of evil there's an innocent face  
Oh, on top of evil he puts an innocent face  
She was just like a spider  
Only twice as smart  
  
Kindness was a thread  
She used to weave my world apart  
There were three of us seen all over town  
Now there's only two  
Someone's missing  
Guess who?  
  
Now I see how she schemed  
And worked her way in between  
Planted seeds of mistrust  
To make us fight unaware  
Her comforting ways when I would cry  
Shadowed the look of triumph in her eye  
Just like a snake on the limb tree  
A friend is an enemy you can see  
  
'Cause what you got, that'll make you lose  
And then turn around and step in your shoes  
I said they'll turn around  
And step in your shoes  
  
So you better keep an eye on your close friend  
You better watch out for your close friend  
Don't trust nobody  
Don't trust nobody  
Keep an eye on your close friend  
Keep an eye  
Don't trust nobody  
Keep an eye on your close friend  
You better watch out for your close friend

You heard me saying a prayer for  
Some one I really could care for  
  
And then you suddenly appeared before me  
The only one my arms could ever hold  
I heard somebody whisper please adore me  
And when I looked, the moon had turned to gold

Without a dream in my heart  
Without a love of my own

Assassinate the living flame

Bites into your fragile veins

Lured the children never found  
Helped your kings abuse their crown

Plant the seeds of my own plan  
Strong and powerful will fall  
Find a piece of me in all

When we grew up and went to school  
There were certain teachers who would  
Hurt the children any way they could

Upon anything we did  
Exposing every weakness  
However carefully hidden by the kids

When they got home at night, their fat and  
Psychopathic wives would thrash them  
Within inches of their lives

Safe outside my gilded cage

Oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh  
  
I saw a red Camaro today  
And I did a double take  
I thought I saw her face  
We were so reckless and young  
And it all comes back to me  
In storm wash memories  
Summers just around the bend  
Summers just around the bend  
  
Turn up the music loud  
Take the T top down  
And let the chrome shine  
Cruise along the river side  
Feel the wind blow  
Through your hair through your toes  
Got your bare feet hanging out the window  
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh  
  
Looking back looking back  
Sweet wine and sunshine  
Looking back looking back  
Man those were some good times  
Oh oh oh oh  
Everybody sing  
Oh oh oh  
1, 2, 3, 4  
  
Turn up the music loud  
Take the T top down  
And let the chrome shine  
Cruise along the river side  
Feel the wind blow  
Through your hair through your toes  
Got your bare feet hanging out the window  
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh  
  
Turn up the music loud

"542","Oingo Boingo","Only A Lad","Johnny was bad, even as a child everybody could tell,  
Everyone said, ""If you don't get straight  
You'll surely go to hell.""  
  
But Johnny didn't care,  
He was an outlaw by the time that he was ten years old,  
He didn't want to do what he was told  
Just a prankster, juvenile gangster.  
  
His teachers didn't understand,  
They kicked him out of school at a tender early age,  
Just because he didn't want to learn things  
He had other interests  
He liked to burn things!  
  
The lady down the block,  
She had a radio that Johnny wanted oh so bad,  
So he took it the first chance he had.  
Then he shot her in the leg,  
And this is what she said  
""Only a lad. You really can't blame him.""  
""Only a lad. Society made him.""  
""Only a lad. He's our responsibility.""  
Oh, oh, oohh oh oh oh  
""Only a lad. He really couldn't help it.""  
""Only a lad. He didn't want to do it.""  
""Only a lad. He's underprivileged and abused.""  
Perhaps a little bit confused?  
  
Oh oh ohhh, oohhh oh oh ohh whoa whoa whoa  
Oh oh ohhh, oohhh oh oh ohh whoa whoa whoa  
  
His parents gave up, they couldn't influence his attitude,  
Nobody could help.  
The little man had no gratitude.  
  
And when he stole the car,  
Nobody dreamed that he would try to take it so far.  
He didn't mean to hit the poor man,  
Who had to go and die.  
It made the judge cry.  
  
""Only a lad. He really couldn't help it.""  
""Only a lad. He didn't want to do it.""  
""Only a lad. He's underprivileged and abused.""  
Perhaps a little bit confused?  
Oh oh oh, ohh ohh ohh  
  
It's not his fault that he can't believe,  
It's not his fault that he can't behave,  
Society made him go astray.  
  
Perhaps if we're nice he'll go away,  
Perhaps he'll go away,  
He'll go away  
  
""Only a lad. You really can't blame him.""  
""Only a lad. Society made him.""  
""Only a lad. He's our responsibility.""  
  
Hey there Johnny you really don't fool me,  
You get away with murder,  
And you think it's funny!  
You don't give a damn if we live or if we die  
Oh oh oh, ohh ohh ohh oh oh,  
Hey there Johnny boy,  
I hope you fry!  
  
Oh oh oh, ohh ohh ohh oh oh,  
Oh oh oh, ohh ohh ohh oh oh.

Who exist only as voices?

Beyond the rocket-burst among the burned out fireworks

All the years and children gone,

Love is a hard, hard road  
  
He woke up each morning and drove into town  
He stayed all day till her dinner came  
Then he took her to a room, leaned on her wheelchair like a walker  
Covered her with a quilt she'd made  
Only God and a couple of nurses helped the old man shoulder the load  
Love is a hard, hard road  
  
He said ""They tell me this is all that's left,  
Say this hell on Earth is best,  
I lost all those reasons and I still don't understand""  
He cursed his body old and weak  
Tears of failure burned his cheeks  
He said ""Oh, don't you know I prayed to die before this day""  
Love is a hard, hard road  
  
There's a shadow much darker than the valley of death  
When you fear the reaper night not come today  
The line 'em up in Laz-E-Boys out in the sunroom  
The TV keeps the quiet away  
She can't recall his name and she's the only love he's known

Help me through the hopeless haze  
But my oh my  
Tragic eyes  
I can't even recognize myself behind  
So if the answer is no  
Can I change your mind  
  
Out again, a siren screams at half past ten  
And you won't let go  
While I ignore, that we both felt like this  
Before it starts to show  
So if I had a chance  
Would you let me know  
  
Why aren't you shaking  
Step back in time  
Graciously taking  
Oh your too kind  
  
And if the answer is no  
Can I change your mind  
  
We're all the same  
And love is blind  
The sun is gone  
Before it shines  
  
And I said if the answer is no  
Can I change your mind

"580","Don McLean","Infinity","Standin' on a trap door, there's a hole in the ground.  
Underneath the door there's a hole and it goes to infinity.  
Standin' on a dark street, there's a light in the sky.  
Followin' the light through the night as it goes to infinity.  
How can I avoid infinity? How have I annoyed infinity?  
I'm movin' slow in infinity. I even glow in infinity.  
  
[Chorus:]  
It's hard being' small, (hard bein' small)  
Shrinkin' into space, (shrinkin' into space)  
The world is just a ball, (world is just a ball)  
It was my favorite place (it was my favorites place)  
  
Lookin' for the blue skies, watchin' for the sunrise.  
One thing you can bet, you won't see it set in infinity.  
Gonna take a light beam, on the wings of the Jet Stream.  
Gonna take my place in the infinite space of infinity.  
How can I be friends with infinity? Can I make ammends with infinity?  
How can I complain to infinity? What'll I explain to infinity?  
  
(Chorus)  
  
Give me just a time shield before the world has it's fate sealed.  
Protect me for a while before they turn my dial to infinity.  
I hope I can contribute, oh, but I don't want a tribute.  
Hypocrites will come and say somethin' really dumb in infinity.  
I can't hear you sing in infinity. I can't change a thing in infinity.  
The absence of light in infinity gives me a fright in infinity.

Mr. Lincoln I wish you were here  
The Republics changed alot in a hundred years  
I don't think its working like you planned  
Mr Lincoln we sure could use a hand  
  
I just read the headlines in the Nashville News  
And I wish I made this up but I'm afraid its true  
Cause a man was murdered for his money in the street  
He was takin his wife to a nice place to eat  
When they caught the man he did 23 months of time  
He plead insanity like they do now all the time  
Sir what would you have done in 1859  
Now if you shoot someone sir you can get off scott free  
Its the latest thing mr Lincoln can you believe  
Now they sue the manufactures of the guns  
Aint the law changed alot since 1861  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
I just heard the new story on the radio  
They let dangerous men outta prison now yes sir I'm afraid its so  
Because theyre overcrowded and it was only his fifth offense  
And this time hes killed someone does that make any sense  
Now my lawyer called me about a nuisance case  
Cause everybody sues over any little thing these days  
Well at least we're right all we gotta do is tell the truth  
  
He said youre living in the past you romantic fool  
I said you got that right I lean toward the older ways  
And theres damn few back woods lawyers left today

Four little angels of peace are we  
Loving our neighbors so peacefully  
There's really no harm if we do not disarm  
For we always in close harmony  
Four little angels of peace are we  
There is one thing on which we agree  
With fall or with friend  
We will fight to the end  
Just for peace, peace, peace...  
Though we butchered the boss  
And I've own made the choice  
And slaughter the irish no end  
Though I'm injured and poor  
Slaying hoard upon hoard  
We're but playing the part of a friend  
Yes, our arms we ain't twist  
But we'll be elected for peace  
Except in the case of the crook  
We conquered both spears  
Now we're up to our ears  
Just trying to keep what we took  
Three little angels of peace are we  
Living together so blissfully  
Oh, we never fight unless  
We're on the right  
But we're always in the right, you see?  
Three little angels of peace are we  
There is one thing on which we agree  
Until we are wrecks  
We'll break each other's necks  
Just for peace, peace, peace...  
In japan we've the right  
In a generous night  
But the emperor knows peace is finer  
It isn't our fault it's a case of absurd  
We're picked down and buried by china  
Oh, how we're deplored  
I glad did it for the world  
We're a nation of poets and thinkers  
Also, though we bound without pity  
And lay west to his city  
It's because all the chinese are stinkers  
Two little angels of peace are we  
Living together in amity  
We'll sign any pack saying we won't attack  
But it's just a mere formality  
Two little angels of peace are we  
There is one thing on which we agree  
We try to keep calm  
When we gas, we bump  
Just for peace, peace, peace...  
Now I know that our war  
Is a thing to have horror  
And that peaceful fill out  
When we hope we have  
With our love from the start  
I atrocious did all my part  
To civilize nearly the hope we have  
Though you call me sadistic  
Imperialistic  
My armies required a quarry  
And though we may slave  
What's a splendid day today  
After all that we'll say that we're sorry  
Though I fall for the urge  
Of a nice bloody purge  
And living my way I was carrying on  
Though I clean up my schmutz  
Would I hear nazi putz  
It is all for the sake of the aryan  
My ambitions are small  
I want nothing at all  
My plans wouldn't be any littler  
Now that austria's nazi  
It will be hazy-gazy  
To put the whole world under hitler  
Four little angels of peace are we  
Drinking with older of saintity  
Though we slaughter the meek  
We confirm every week  
And we talk it over peacefully  
Four little angels of peace are we  
There is one thing on which we agree  
We'll shout and we'll shell  
We'll get each other's hell  
Just for peace, peace, peace...

Walking barefoot by the stream  
Come on to me, Your hair's softly falling  
On my face as in a dream  
And the time will be our time  
And the grass won't pay no mind  
  
Saying nothing, lying where the sun is  
Baking down upon our sides  
My lips touch you, with their soft wet kisses  
Your hands gentle in reply  
And the time will be our time  
And the grass won't pay no mind  
  
Child, touch my soul with your cries  
And the music will know what we've found  
I, hear a hundred good-byes  
But today I hear only one sound  
The moment we're living is now  
Now now now now now now now  
  
Young bird flying, and a soft wind blowing  
Cools the sweat inside my palms  
Close my eyes, hear the flowers growing  
As you lay sleeping in my arms  
And the time will be our time  
And the grass won't pay no mind  
No the grass won't pay no mind

A woman is tender thing.  
To see her cry, a sad, sad thing.  
  
Nothing touches me deeper inside,  
Than a tear from a woman's eye.  
A tear from a woman's eye.  
Hmmm  
  
A woman's tears dropping on her cheek,  
Is like a sound of thunder, that loudly it rings.  
'Cause when I see her cry, I know she hurts inside.

Is a tear from a woman's eye.

"597","Kelly Family","Life Can Be So Beautiful","I don't want to waste all this time  
I just wanna start living for real  
I don't want to waste all my time  
Being locked up in my own little movie  
Part of me wants to stay a child  
The other is saying Angelo you better grow up quick  
For God has given you a baby boy  
And he wants you to try and be a good father  
  
Life can be so beautiful  
It depends what you make of it all  
Oh I believe that life can be so wonderful  
As long as I try to treat everyday like my last  
  
I think I'm not thanking God enough  
For all the great presents I've received in my life  
Especially for my beautiful and loving wife  
Oh Kira I think without you I would never have made it  
  
Life can be so beautiful  
It depends what you make of it all  
Having children and a wife is something wonderful  
And I'll never ever trade with something else in this world

Wide eyed and deeper in your gaze,  
And bluer than the bright that's in the cave.  
There is a city,  
Came out from you, Atlantis  
In ruins, sunken below the waves  
But in the city,  
Where there is no one.  
What's the point of being free, eh?  
When there is nothing there to tie me down,  
Oh, no more here.  
The bluest city,  
Covered in coral and coral,  
On sea chests,  
And sealed Jamaician tales.  
There is nobody  
To count the soldiering meandering whales,  
With a shoal of herring amongst the sails.  
But in the city,  
Where there is no one.  
What's the point of being free, eh?  
When there is nothing there to tie me down,  
Oh, no more here.  
There is the city Atlantis.

Put me up on the game when I step through the do'  
Ya know, some of these niggas is so deceptive  
Using my styles like a contraceptive  
I hope ya get burnt, it seems ya haven't learnt  
It's the nick nack patty wack, I still got the bigger sack  
So put your gun away, run away, 'cause I'm back (why?)  
Hit em up, get em up, spit em up, now  
Tell me what's going on  
It make me want to holler, 'cause my dollars come in ozones  
Lone for the break-up, so take off your clothes  
And quit trying to spit at my motherfucking hoes  
Seaking of hoes, I'll get to the point

You'se a flea and I'm the big Dogg  
I'll scratch you off my balls with my motherfucking paws

Ain't that something, talk shit and I'm dumping  
I had your whole fucking block bumping  
Don't sweat, but check the technique, I'm unique like China  
Ya never find the bomb-a-rama then this Nigga behind ya  
So peek-a-boo, clear the way, I'm coming through  
One-two, three, you can't see me  
I'm a G like that strapped with hit hard tactics  
A fucking menace, using hoes like tennis rackets  
It's on again, it's on and popping  
All I see is green, so there ain't no stopping  
I want to see some panties dropping  
I'm coming from L.A., she used to chill with Dre up in Compton  
(All I ever did was just use that hoe  
Show her my dickies, get with these, and kick flows)  
I'm dishing out blues, I'm upsetting like bad news  
Cut off khakis, french braids, and house shoes  
Kurupt, the name's often marked for catching slugs  
And I smoke weed for the fuck of it  
Ruff and rugged shit, it's unexplanitory how I gets wicked  
But it's mandatory that I kick it  
Check it, I'm runnin hoes in 94, now must I prove it  
Hoes call me Sugar Ray for the way I be sticking and moving  
Prepare for a war, it's on, I'm head hunting  
Hit the button, and light shit up like Red Dawn  
Peep, the massacre from a verbal assassin  
Murdering with rhymes packing Tec-9's for some action  
You really don't know, do you, you fucking with a hog  
You can't do me, I'm going out looney like O-Dog

Diggity Daz out of the motherfucking cut once mo'  
So grab a seat and grab your gin and juice and check out the flow  
I flip flop and serve hoes with a fat dick  
Till I die I'm still screaming that (bitches ain't shit)  
Now I'm the mack daddy, had he, not known about  
The city where I'm from, dumb diddy dumb  
As you groove to the gangster shit  
The D-O-Double-G the P-O-you-N-D, the gangsta clique  
Now as the Pound break it down with the gangsta funk

So I blaze up the chronic, so I can get high  
I promise I'll smoke chronic till the day that I die

I got a sick sense, I got a reason to worry  
And sometimes I'm dense but these thoughts come in a flurry  
You say they're nonsense but I dreamt you left in a hurry  
I don't think I'll ever make it alone

And my breathing's out of whack like a drum machine  
I know if I pass out you'd resuscitate me, right?  
Without you I'll never make it  
  
Is it okay now or did you meet someone better  
Without a Mohawk with a real job and a sweater?  
Leaving me shell shocked, steady getting ready for a header

Standing on the edge of the great divide  
You're pushing all the right buttons to make worlds collide  
Would you stab me in the back like a homicide  
Or leave me buried in your bullshit like a landslide?  
  
Are you biding your time with me  
Waiting for someone better to come along?  
As I sit and I scream this song  
  
Are you biding your time with me  
Waiting for someone better to come along?  
If you are I proved you wrong  
  
Both ends burn, I'll be waiting for you  
I won't turn, I'll be waiting for you  
Both ends burn, I'll be waiting for you  
  
Don't change your mind 'cause you'll be killing me  
Hitting at an all time low and there's no where left to go  
  
Don't change your mind 'cause you'll be killing me  
Striking at an all time low, and there's no where left to go

Underneath the mistletoe  
Last night  
He didn't see me creep  
Down the stairs to have a peek

He thought I was up in the bedroom fast asleep  
  
Then, I saw mommy kissing Santa Claus  
Underneath the Christmas tree last night

Was I really awake?  
I move in closer, but better look away

"603","Grateful Dead","She Belongs To Me","She's got everything she needs, she's an artist, she don't look back.  
Takes the dark out of the nighttime, she paints the daytime black.  
You will start out standing, proud to steal her anything she sees.  
But you will wind up peeking through a key hole, down upon your bended knees.  
  
She never stumbles, she's got no place to fall.  
She's nobody's child, the law can't touch her at all.  
She wears an Egyptian ring, that sparkles before she speaks.  
She's a hypnotist collector, you are a walking antique.  
  
Bow down to her on Sunday, salute her when her birthday comes.  
For Halloween but her a trumpet, and for Christmas, buy her drums.  
She's got everything she needs, she's an artist, she don't look back.  
Takes the dark out of the nighttime, you know she paints the daytime black.

He smiled and seem to tell me so all through it  
He knew it, I know  
He's real, and the world is alive and shining  
I feel such a wonderful drive t'wards valentining  
He touched me, I simply have to face the fact  
He touched me  
Control myself and try to act  
As if I remember my name  
But he touched me, he touched me  
And suddenly nothing is the same  
'Cause he touched me, he touched me  
And suddenly nothing, nothing, nothing is the same

On the feast of Stephen,  
When the snow lay round about,  
Deep and crisp and even.  
Brightly shown the moon that night,  
Though the frost was cruel,  
When a poor man came in sight,  
Gathering winter fuel.  
  
Hither, page, and stand by me.  
If thou know it telling:  
Yonder peasant, who is he?  
Where and what his dwelling?  
Sire, he lives a good league hence,  
Underneath the mountain,  
Right against the forest fence  
By Saint Agnes fountain.  
  
Bring me flesh, and bring me wine.  
Bring me pine logs hither.  
Thou and I will see him dine  
When we bear the thither.  
Page and monarch, forth they went,  
Forth they went together  
Through the rude wind's wild lament  
And the bitter weather.  
  
Sire, the night is darker now,  
And the wind blows stronger.  
Fails my heart, I know not how.  
I can go no longer.  
Ark my footsteps my good page,  
Tread thou in them boldly:  
Thou shalt find the winter's rage  
Freeze thy blood less coldly.  
  
In his master's step he trod,  
Where the snow lay dented.  
Heat was in the very sod  
Which the saint had printed.  
Therefore, Christian men, be sure,  
Wealth or rank possessing,  
Ye who now will bless the poor  
Shall yourselves find blessing

The maddest things we ever found in bins  
He clutches them and looks at you and grins  
  
Here comes Pockets  
The children wary of what they may contain  
The linen may have changed, the contents same  
A trouser-treasure island with no name  
  
And socially at the platform that the timetable forgot  
Picking up used tickets in a station of have-nots  
When you're on that train of thought  
You pass some pretty funky stops  
When you're on that train of thought  
You pass some pretty funky stops  
That's the Pocket, let him be  
That's the Pocket, let him be  
  
Here comes Pockets  
Picking up the things we cannot see  
A bicycle, a dame, a Christmas tree  
Things of no value to you or me  
  
Here comes Pockets  
Reduced through history to just a crawl  
History turns the tall into the small  
But natural born trawlers love to trawl  
  
And the guitar of his dreams hangs upon some wall  
Or laying underneath the staircase in a hall  
We can carry dreams but we can't hold them all  
That's why we learn the Blues before we actually fall  
That's the Pocket, let him be  
That's the Pocket, let him be  
  
And he's clinging on to hope  
Like the oak tree to the gale  
'Cause finding one love letter in a sky high jumble sale  
Is one single reason, why the Pocket will not fail

He was ten and it was 1952  
His daddy worked hard from sunup to sundown  
And the goin' got tough behind them ol' grey mules  
  
The farm grew to be a moneymaker  
And the house he lived in grew up room by room  
The boy worked hard but soon got tired of farmin'  
So he slipped away one night 'neath the harvest moon  
  
His neck was red as Alabama clay  
But the city's call pulled him away  
He's got a factory job and runs a big machine  
He don't miss the farm or the fields of green  
  
Now the city's just a prison without fences  
His job is just a routine he can't stand  
And at night he dreams of wide-open spaces  
Fresh dirt between his toes and on his hands  
  
Then one day a picture came inside a letter  
Of a young girl with a baby in her arms  
And the words she wrote would change his life forever  
So he went to raise his family on the farm  
  
His neck is red as Alabama clay  
Now he's goin' home this time to stay  
Where the roots run deep on the family tree  
And the tractor rolls through the fields of green

Now he's goin' home this time to stay  
Where the roots run deep on the family tree

"614","Joni Mitchell","Don Juan's Reckless Daughter","I'm Don Juan's reckless daughter  
I came out two days on your tail  
Those two bald-headed days in November  
Before the first snowflakes sail  
Out on the vast and subtle plains of mystery  
A split tongue spirit talks  
Noble as a nickel chief  
Striking up an old juke box  
And he says:  
""Snakes along the railroad tracks.""  
He says, ""Eagles in jet trails""  
He says, ""Coils around feathers and talons on scales  
Gravel under the belly plates""  
He says, ""Wind in the Wings""  
He says, ""Big bird dragging its tail in the dust  
Snake kite flying on a string.""  
  
I come from open prairie  
Given some wisdom and a lot of jive!  
Last night the ghosts of my old ideas  
Reran on channel five  
And it howled so spooky for its eagle soul  
I nearly broke down and cried  
But the split tongue spirit laughed at me  
He says, ""Your serpent cannot be denied.""  
Our serpents love the whisky bars  
They love the romance of the crime  
But didn't I see a neon sign  
Fester on your hotel blind  
And a country road come off the wall  
And swoop down at the crowd at the bar  
And put me at the top of your danger list  
Just for being so much like you are!  
  
You're a coward against the altitude  
You're a coward against the flesh  
Coward, caught between yes and no  
Reckless this time on the line for yes, yes, yes!  
Reckless brazen in the play  
Of your changing traffic lights  
Coward, slinking down the hall  
to another restless night  
As we center behind the eight ball  
As we rock between the sheets  
As we siphon the colored language  
Off the farms and the streets  
Here in Good-Old-God-Save-America  
the home of the brave and the free  
We are all hopelessly oppressed cowards  
Of some duality  
Of restless multiplicity  
(Oh say can you see)  
  
Restless for streets and honky tonks  
Restless for home and routine  
Restless for country-safety-and her  
Restless for the likes of reckless me  
Restless sweeps like fire and rain  
Over virgin wilderness  
It prowls like hookers and thieves  
Through bolt locked tenements  
Behind my bolt locked door  
The eagle and the serpent are at war in me  
The serpent fighting for blind desire  
The eagle for clarity  
What strange prizes these battles bring  
These hectic joys-these weary blues  
Puffed up and strutting when I think I win  
Down and shaken when I think I lose  
There are rivets up here in this eagle  
There are box cars down there on your snake  
And we are twins of spirit  
No matter which route home we take  
Or what we forsake  
We're going to come up to the eyes of clarity  
And we'll go down to the beads of guile  
There is danger and education  
In living out such a reckless life style  
I touched you on the central plains  
It was plane to train my twin  
It was just plane shadow to train shadow  
But to me it was skin to skin  
The spirit talks in spectrums  
He talks to mother earth to father sky  
Self indulgence to self denial  
Man to woman  
Scales to feathers  
You and I  
Eagles in the sky  
You and I  
Snakes in the grass  
You and I  
Crawl and fly  
You and I

The early dawn, the shades of time  
Twilight crawling through my windowpane  
  
Am I awake or do I dream,  
The strangest pictures I have seen  
Night is day and twilight's gone away  
  
With your head held high and your scarlet lies  
You came down to me from the open skies  
It's either real or it's a dream  
There's nothing that is in between  
  
Twilight, I only meant to stay awhile  
Twilight, I gave you time to steal my mind  
Away from me.  
  
Across the night I saw your face  
You disappeared without a trace  
You brought me here, but can you take me back  
  
Inside the image of your light  
That now is day and once was night  
You lead me here and then you go away.  
  
Twilight, I only meant to stay awhile  
Twilight, I gave you time to steal my mind  
Away from me.  
  
You brought me here, but can you take me back again?

I could tell the world you're doin' wrong  
That I was stringin' you along  
And if it all were true

When I got through with all my lies

'Cause my heart would still want you  
Cry, oh, Lord  
I could tell my friends I threw you down  
And slander your name all over town

I know I'd still want you  
If I said I'm happy to be free  
The only one I'd fool is me  
Because it isn't true  
I know I'd still want you  
What's the use to say that you're no good  
When I'd crawl back if I could  
No matter what you do  
I know I'd still want you  
Cry, oh, Lord  
I could smile and say that I don't care  
And then go home and pull my hair  
But what good would it do  
I know I'd still want you  
I could say that someone put me wise  
And get revenge by telling lies  
But when I got all through  
I know I'd still want you  
If the things I said was to break your heart  
I'd be the first to take your part  
'Cause if all these lies were true  
I know I'd still want you  
Cry, oh, Lord

Across the canyon wall  
The cattle are quiet and still  
Dusty, sore and tired  
I build myself a fire  
As a full moon  
Peaks over the hills.  
  
A blanket for my bed  
A saddle for my head  
I'll sleep  
But in my dreams I'll stray  
Back across the miles  
To where my darlin' smiles  
In memories of old Santa Fe.  
  
Adios mi corinyo  
She told me that day  
As I kissed her softly  
And then rode away.  
Now I lie beneath the stars  
Without her in my arms  
So lonesome  
And so far away  
But each night  
I go back there  
In my dreams  
And in my prayers  
And in memories of old Santa Fe.  
  
Adios mi corinyo  
She told me that day  
As I kissed her softly  
And then rode away.  
  
She's waitin'  
There I know  
But for now  
All I can hold  
Are my memories  
Of old Sata Fe

Gonna take a ride so far  
To the land of sun tan lotion  
Gonna take it state by state  
Til I hit the golden gate  
Get my feet wet in the ocean

In the dream we had,  
For me it's not over...  
  
Walkin on the bridge on day  
Lookin out across the bay  
I saw a rippling in the water  
Once a big ship had passed  
I borrowed a traveller's glass  
And focused on  
The ocean's daughter  
Kind of like a wave confused  
Dancing in the sunset hews  
She waved to me  
And called me over  
  
I'm still living  
In the dream we had,  
For me it's not over...  
  
Talkin' bout a friend of mine  
Talkin' bout a gold mine  
Richest vein in any mountain  
Talkin' bout the enemy  
Inside of me  
Talkin' bout  
That youthful fountain  
Talkin' bout you and me  
Talkin' bout eternity  
Talkin' bout the big time

In the dream we had,

Transitioning from fitting in to standing out  
Los Angeles Cabanas or Atlanta South

Embarrassed to pull my camera out

To pull my Phantom out

But I don't wanna feel the need to wear disguises around

And they think they can market you  
However they decide to nahh  
But Forty told me to do me  
And don't listen to anybody that knew me

Tell her the times have but I have not changed  
All my friends know that I still feel the same  
If you see her and she mentions my name  
  
If you see her ask her for me  
If the dreamer in her ever set her free  
Does she know now what the words I sing mean  
If you see her would you ask her for me  
  
[Chorus]  
Everything I told her then was true  
Everything was true at the time  
But time has a way of changing everything  
The truth has a way of changing all the time  
  
If you see her and she mentions my name  
Tell her for me that she was not to blame  
There's no reason now for her to feel ashamed  
If you see her and she mentions my name

If you see her and she mentions my name  
Tell her the times have but I have not changed

"653","Warren Zevon","Genius","I've got a bitter pot of je ne sais quoi  
Guess what---I'm stirring it with a monkey's paw  
Since I saw you coming out of my barber's shop  
In that skimpy little halter top  
  
Did you light the candles? Did you put on ""Kind of Blue""?  
Did you use that Ivy Leaage voodoo on him, too?  
He thinks he'll be alright but he doesn't know for sure  
Like every other unindicted coconspirator  
  
Mata Hari had a house in France  
Where she worked on all her secret plans  
Men were falling for her sight unseen  
She was a genius  
  
There's a face in every window of the Songwriter's Neighborhood  
Everybody's your best friend whey you're doing well--I mean good  
The poet who lived next door when you were young and poor  
Grew up to be a backstabbing entrepreneur  
  
Albert Einstein was a ladies' man  
While he was working on his universal plan  
He was making out like Charlie Sheen  
He was a genius  
  
When you dropped me and you staked your claim  
On a V.I.P. who could make your name  
You latched on to him and I became  
A minor inconvenience  
  
Your protege don't care about art  
I'm the one who always told you you were smart  
You broke my heart into smithereens  
And that took genius  
  
You and the barber make a handsome pair  
Guess what---I never liked the way he cut your hair  
I didn't like the way he turned your head  
But there's nothing I can do or say I haven't done or said  
  
Everybody needs a place to stand  
And a method for their schemes and scams  
If I could only get my record clean  
I'd be a genius

"654","Falco","Falco Rides Again","These are the given lyrics for this song, but to my ears,  
Most of the first verse sounds to me to be in German.  
This is the story of a lonely man  
Who's seen the world  
From japan to Afghanistan  
Hey! ho!  
  
Everybody thought that I was gone for good  
But I'm back, understood  
Hey! ho!  
  
I've been through the snow and the storm  
Felt the cold  
No one to keep me warm  
Agony and pain  
  
Falco rides again, bang bang  
I won't break  
I won't bend  
Falco rides again  
It's me and my gang  
I came back just like a boomerang  
I'll fight 'till the end  
Falco rides again  
I've been up, I've been down  
I've been pushed around  
Beated, mistreated,  
Gagged and bound  
Hey! ho!  
  
Not a soul in the world thought I would survive  
Took every muscle in my body to stay alive  
Hey! ho!  
I'll break down the walls  
No more defeat  
I want the taste of victory  
Revenge is sweet  
  
Rides again!

"655","Clash","This Is England","I hear a gang fire on a human factory farm  
Are they howling out or doing somebody harm  
On a catwalk jungle somebody grabbed my arm  
A voice spoke so cold it matched the weapon in her palm  
  
This is England  
This knife of Sheffield steel  
This is England  
This is how we feel  
  
Time on his hands freezing in those clothes  
He won't go for the carrot  
They beat him by the pole  
Some sunny day confronted by his soul  
He's out at sea, too far off, he can't go home  
  
This is England  
What we're supposed to die for  
This is England  
And we're never gonna cry no more  
  
Black shadow of the Vincent  
Falls on a Triumph line  
I got my motorcycle jacket  
But I'm walking all the time  
South Atlantic wind blows  
Ice from a dying creed  
I see no glory  
When will we be free  
  
This is England  
We can chain you to the rail  
This is England  
We can kill you in a jail  
  
The British boots go kick them  
Got 'em in the head  
Police ain't watchin'  
The newspapers been read  
Who cares to protest  
A (???) in the eye like a flare  
Out came the batons and  
The British warned themselves  
  
This is England  
The land of (il)legal dances  
This is England  
Land of a thousand stances  
This is England  
This knife of Sheffield steel  
This is England  
This is how we feel  
This is England  
This is England

Well she looks like a model  
On the cover of a magazine

To be a minute over seventeen  
  
Meanwhile I was thinkin'  
  
Well if she's in the mood  
No need to break it  
I got the chance and I oughta take it  
If she can dance we can make it

Un incanto vien forse con te?  
Freme l'aria per dove tu vai,  
Spunta un fiore ove passa 'l tuo pi?.  
  
Io non chiedo qual plaga beata

Non ti chiedo se Ninfa, se Fata,  
Se una bionda parvenza sei tu!

Cosa ci hai nel tuo magico dir?  
Se mi guardi, un'ebbrezza m'assale,  
Se mi parli, mi sento morir!

Look for my baby, he's nowhere around.  
I traced his footsteps down to the shore,  
Afraid he's gone forever more.

I looked at the sea, and it seemed to say,  
""I took your baby from you, away.""  
I heard a voice, cryin' in the deep,  
""Come join your baby in my endless sleep.""  
  
Why did we quarrel? Why did we fight?  
Why did I leave him alone tonight?  
That's why his footsteps ran to the sea.  
That's why my baby is gone from me.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Ran in the water, heart full of fear.  
There, in the breakers, I saw him near.  
Reached for my baby, held him to me,  
Stole him away from the endless sleep.  
  
I looked at the sea and it seemed to say,  
""You took your baby from me, away.""  
My heart cried out, ""He's mine to keep!""  
I saved my baby from that endless sleep.  
I saved my baby from that endless sleep.  
I saved my baby from that endless sleep.

How much can you take when you've taken all you can  
Hoe can you act when you've never seen the script  
How can you choose when you don't know which is right  
How far can you go if you've been there before

How can you heal someone that doesn't want to heal

Than to stay and just pretend

I made all my plans  
And she has made hers  
She kept me in mind  
But I wasn't sure  
I searched every room  
For a way to escape  
But every time  
I tried to leave  
She keeps holding on to me  
For dear life  
And blocking my way

It's harder to leave  
With my heart on my sleeve  
Than to stay and just pretend

She already understands everything  
Won't you stay?

And she already knows how it goes  
And where she stands

You set the rules in your little world  
But girls grow up and throw their toys away  
You're a big girl now but you still wanna play

You dress them up the way you want to  
(Girl we're living)  
You make them do just what you want them to

But I'm just another doll in your dollhouse to you  
  
We're living in a dollhouse  
We're living in a dollhouse  
Girl we're living in a dollhouse  
You may feel safe and sound  
But your dollhouse, girl, is falling down  
  
It's all been neatly arranged in your mind  
Every detail fits your own design  
Every room is perfectly in place  
But I can see the sadness, baby, on your face  
You had a plan and darling like a child  
You thought it's down to fashion, down to style  
But your little dreamhouse is runnin' wild  
Before your very eyes we're shrinking down to size  
  
We're living in a dollhouse  
We're living in a dollhouse  
Girl we're living in a dollhouse  
You may feel safe and sound  
But your dollhouse, girl, is falling down  
  
Everything's as you dreamed it would be  
But there's something wrong that you can't see  
Room by room you keep looking for some little flaw  
A crack somewhere in your dollhouse wall  
Something, girl, that will explain away  
The hurt you feel, darling, when we play  
  
Your little dolls they got grip on you  
Until you're just another doll in your dollhouse too  
We're living in a dollhouse  
Girl, we're living in a dollhouse  
Oh we're living in a dollhouse  
We may feel safe and sound  
But our dollhouse, girl, is falling down  
Oh we're living in a dollhouse

A woman a man never never land and a storybook ending  
Leading roles and my heros upon the silver screen  
I played em all but always came up empty  
But one of these days I'll be in a movie with 'em  
  
Cause I believe that fantasy  
Is one step from reality  
For those of us who dream of love  
And I believe cause I want to  
There's some one man for someone who believes in love  
To not give up  
Even though you've heard so many say  
That's the way the story goes

I'm lookin' for a yellow brick road  
That'll carry me to his door  
I'm lookin for a new love story  
Oh one that's never been told before  
  
And I have searched the oceans of many a man's eyes  
But I have yet to feel like more than some deserted island  
I know a relationship will come for me in time  
And I can't wait to see his face on my horizon  
Cause one of these days he'll sail into my life  
  
Cause I believe that fantasy  
Is one step from reality  
For those of us who dream of love  
And I believe cause I want to  
There's some one man for someone who believes in love

Wailing away on the wall on the strand  
As you danced to the Turkish song of the damned  
  
You remember when the ship went down  
You left me on the deck  
The captain's corpse jumped up  
And threw his arms around my neck  
For all these years I've had him on my back  
This debt cannot be paid with all your jack  
  
And as I sit and talk to you I see your face go white  
This shadow hanging over me  
Is no trick of the light  
The spectre on my back will soon be free

Fresh in that tuxedo  
Cumberbun with no suspenders  
My torpedo, you libido  
Need to chat (Chip, chop it up, shoot the breeze!)  
I'm your are-o-l-a-I-d-s, release the squeeze or release the keys  
To the shackles on her wrist, she can tackle some of this  
Smack on smack on some of this Dick Tracy  
Arrest her, book her, fingerprint your hooker  
You took her to the club and now her body is full of liquor  
Off that Butterscotch Schnapps and Bailey's Irish Cream  
She's a damsel in distress impressed with stylish things  
What ya mean? (Chip, chop it up, shoot the breeze!)

To put on a pair of panties much less a pair of jeans or the leotard  
But I got to start by complimenting you on your physique  
You unique, you best believe I'm gon' skeet once I speak  
Spoke, spit, spatter, spat and I macked her just like that  
But it takes years of perseverance and experience to get that cat!  
So why don't I chase this Hennessy down with some of that  
On your back, like a cheerleader missing the final stack!  
As we strut skip the line through the glass window glance  
We look fine, right on time  
As we step in the place the nursery's crunk we've come to play  
  
Everybody's watching 'cause them furs just hit the door  
While the gator's creeping, crawling oh so wicked across that floor  
To the V.I.P. where we proceed to give you what you need  
Throw your hands up if you feel me!! Throw your hands up if you feel me!!  
'Cause we well designed and fine as wine  
Feel good to be fly, so don't you ask me why  
I got the ladies in line, because they can't deny  
So raise your hands to the sky 'cause we super fly

With the sun in my heart  
All my worry blew away  
When you taught me how to say  
  
Grab your coat and get you rhat  
Leave your worry on the doorstep  
Just direct your feet  
To the sunny side of the street  
  
Can't you hear a pitter pat?  
And that happy tune is your steop.  
Life can be so sweet  
On the sunny side of the street.  
  
I jused to walk in the shade  
With those blues on parade  
But I'm not afraid  
This Rover crossed over.

Gold dust at my feet  
On the sunny side of the street.

"686","Tool","Disgustipated","And the angel of the lord came unto me  
snatching me up from my place of slumber.  
And took me on high and higher still  
Until we moved to the spaces betwixt the air itself.  
And he brought me into a vast farmlands of our own midwest.  
And as we descended cries of impending doom rose from the soil.  
One thousand nay a million voices full of fear.  
And terror possessed me then.  
And I begged ""Angel of the Lord what are these tortured screams?""  
And the angel said unto me,  
""These are the cries of the carrots, the cries of the carrots!  
You see, Reverend Maynard,  
Tomorrow is harvest day and to them it is the holocaust.""  
And I sprang from my slumber drenched in sweat  
Like the tears of one million terrified brothers and roared,  
""Hear me now, I have seen the light!  
They have a consciousness, they have a life, they have a soul!  
Damn you! Let the rabbits wear glasses! Save our brothers!""  
Can I get an amen? Can I get a hallelujah? Thank you Jesus.  
Life feeds on life feeds on life feeds on life feeds on.  
This is necessary.  
It was daylight when you woke up in your ditch.  
You looked up at your sky then.  
That made blue be your color. You had your knife there with you too.  
When you stood up there was goo all over your clothes.  
Your hands were sticky.  
You wiped them on your grass, so now your color was green.  
Oh Lord, why did everything always have to keep changing like this.  
You were already getting nervous again.  
Your head hurt and it rang when you stood up.  
Your head was almost empty.  
It always hurt you when you woke up like this.  
You crawled up out of your ditch onto your gravel road and began to walk,  
waiting for the rest of your mind to come back to you.  
You can see the car parked far down the road and you walked toward it.  
""If God is our Father,"" you thought, ""then Satan must be our cousin.""  
Why didn't anyone else understand these important things?  
You got to your car and tried all the doors.  
They were locked. It was a red car and it was new.  
There was an expensive leather camera case laying on the seat.  
Out across your field, you could see two tiny people walking by your woods.  
You began to walk towards them.  
Now red was your color and, of course,  
Those little people out there were yours too.

"689","Zao","All Else Failed","(A throne in Heaven sat empty for 33 years.) Why? For what do we strive that
will bring us closer. No human deed will show us approved. For two thousand
years we've chokedon our efforts. Only tolay down and die. Things change, and
things stay the same. Through all these trials I cannot compose myself. Till
there is a time no heaviness fills my heart. I canot compose myself. So in all
this, there must arise a plan. A strategy to subdue the schemes. For
generation upon generation God retained a silence that shattered the hearts of
men. And for a season, all else failed. There is no other name, given among
men whereby they might be saved. In all these years when men crawled the earth
choking on his tears, no composure, nor completion reigned. No self righteous
cleansing. Leaning on the strength of self or another man... No human effort
can bring holyness or even the strength to stand. There is  
no explanation for this reasoning. The only thing in life that is constant is

They're just not fair

Wipe away the tear  
New night, feel right  
Knowing that you're here  
Dancing with you all the time, and don't you think that it's a crime  
  
Back street never meet  
Never say goodbye  
I know where you go  
But I don't know why  
You say that it's from above, and I say this is modern love

"694","Elvis Costello","I Can't Stand Up For Falling Down","I'm the living result  
I'm a man who's been hurt a little too much  
And I've tasted the bitterness of my own tears  
Sadness is all my lonely heart can feel  
I can't stand up for falling down  
I can't stand up for falling down  
Simple though love is  
Still it confused me  
Why I'm not loved the way I should be  
Now I've lived with heartaches  
And I've roomed with fear  
I've dealt with despair  
And I've wrestled with tears  
I can't stand up for falling down  
I can't stand up for falling down  
The vow that we made  
You broke it in two  
But that don't stop me from loving you  
I can't stand up for falling down  
I can't stand up for falling down

"695","Fatboy Slim","That Old Pair Of Jeans","Ah, ah ah, ah ah ah, ahhhh ah ah, ah ah ah  
ah, ah ah, ah ah ah, ahhhh ah ah, ah ah ah  
  
All you used to do was put me down  
But I found a way to pick myself up off the ground  
And all you used to do was criticize me  
But now I found the good and I emphasise, ya see  
  
You would always get so sensitive  
And try to turn your transgressions into my guiltiness  
But now I'm certain of the way I live  
And what I'm responsible for in this twisted game  
  
And it's such a shame  
That you try to make pain  
Another word for my name  
Whether giving or receiving  
It's one the same  
Just one more link  
In your long-ass chain  
But it's time to break  
This frame and my strengthful will  
Time to jump off this negative cycle we've built  
Gave my heart  
But my self-respection you won't steal  
Now it's time to let ya know if you can hear me feel me  
  
Ah, ah ah, ah ah ah, ahhhh ah ah, ah ah ah  
ah, ah ah, ah ah ah, ahhhh ah ah, ah ah ah  
  
So I asked my mama for her two cents  
And then I asked my little sister and I asked my friend  
Then I asked my papa once and I asked him again  
Came two little consensus from all them opinions  
That life is too short to be unhappy  
And since I know what I'm worth there'll be no settling for dirt  
Knowing what I deserve is gold  
If I want diamonds then I can't settle for coal  
  
Maybe I was just too strong to let go  
Maybe I was just too weak to let it show  
Maybe I was just too stubborn to say ""No""  
But whatever the case I can't take it no more  
  
Ah, ah ah, ah ah ah, ahhhh ah ah, ah ah ah  
ah, ah ah, ah ah ah, ahhhh ah ah, ah ah ah  
  
Ah, ah ah, ah ah ah, ahhhh ah ah, ah ah ah

Ah, ah ah, ah ah ah, ahhhh ah ah, ah ah ah  
ah, ah ah, ah ah ah, ahhhh ah ah, ah ah ah  
  
Sometimes I think maybe we'll patch it all up  
Like a favourite pair of jeans that you won't give up on  
Or maybe one of these arguments will make up  
And start again like when we started this up  
Back when everything was fresh  
And every moment a blessing  
I'd laugh at all of your jokes  
You'd listen to my suggestions  
One mind, one soul,  
With common decimation  
Now we can't help but fight over the direction

"696","James Taylor","Up On The Roof","When this old world starts a getting me down  
And people are just too much for me to face  
I'll climb way up to the top of the stairs  
And all my cares just drift right into space  
On the roof, it's peaceful as can be  
And there the world below don't bother me, no, no  
So when I come home feeling tired and beat  
I'll go up where the air is fresh and sweet  
I'll get far away from the hustling crowd  
And all that rat-race noise down in the street  
On the roof, that's the only place I know  
Look at the city, baby  
Where you just have to wish to make it so  
Let's go up on the roof  
And at night the stars they put on a show for free  
And, darling, you can share it all with me  
That's what I said, keep on telling you  
That right smack dab in the middle of town  
I found a paradise that's trouble proof  
And if this old world starts a getting you down  
There's room enough for two, up on the roof  
Up on the roof, up on a roof  
Everything is alright, everything is alright  
Come on  
Drop what you're doin' tonight and  
Climb up the stairs and see with me, babe  
We got the stars above and the city lights below  
Up on the roof, now

It's hard not to stare, the way you moving your body  
Like you never had a love, never had love  
  
[Verse 1 - lil wayne]  
When you was just a young'un, your looks were so precious  
But now your grown up, so fly it's like a blessing  
But you can't have a man look at you for 5 seconds  
Without you being insecure  
You never credit yourself so when you got older  
It's seems like you came back 10 times over  
Now you're sitting here in this damn corner  
Looking through all your thoughts and looking over your shoulder

See you had a lot of crooks tryna steal your heart  
Never really had luck, couldn't never figure out  
How to love, how to love

Te fuiste pero nunca me dijiste adios  
Me dejaste en mil pedazos por no saber amar como amar?  
La vida va pasando tu carita no a cambiado  
Esos ojitos negros que siguen suplicando como amar como amar?  
Te acuerdas de esa noche eramos adolescentes queria darte un beso  
Y tu tan inocente me tenias locamente enamorado, me tenias locamente
enamorado.  
Y ya lo ves, lo que fue ya fue te marchaste poco a poco de mi lado y yo sigo
locamente enamorado aqui sigo locamente enamorado.  
Te fuiste pero nunca me dijiste adios me dejaste en mil pedazos por no saber
amar como amar?  
La vida va pasando tu carita no a cambiado esos ojitos negros que siguen
suplicando como amar

That you deserve the best  
You're beautiful

Force myself across the edge

Broken promise hollow ring

You can bring your soul alive  
It can happen to you  
It can happen to me  
It can happen to everyone eventually  
  
As you happen to say  
It can happen today  
As it happens  
It happens in every way

Down by the Riverside motel  
It's 10 below and falling  
By a 99 cent store

When it's cold and there's no music

And here I am concentrating girl

Now the sound of your laughter  
Trails off through the midnight sky  
  
As the miles go by cities come and go  
When you close your eyes  
And listen to the radio  
Girl can you hear my song  
The signal is clear and strong  
Across the miles tonight  
  
And I am sending you this message  
Through the wires tonight  
Just close your eyes and hold on tight

"713","Gary Numan","A Prayer For The Unborn","So, I prayed...  
But you weren't listening.  
Making miracles?  
So, I begged...  
But you were far away.  
Saving souls perhaps?  
So, I screamed...  
But she was very small  
And you have worlds to mend.  
So, she died...  
And you were glorious.  
But you were somewhere else.  
If you are my shepherd  
Then I'm lost and no one can find me.  
If you are my saviour  
Then I'm dead and no one can help me.  
If you are my glory  
Then I'm sick and no one can cure me.  
If you light my darkness  
Then I'm blind and no one can see me.  
If you are my father  
Then love lies abandoned and bleeding.  
If you are my comfort  
Then nightmares are real and deceiving.  
If you are my answer  
Then I must have asked the wrong question.  
I'd spit on your heaven  
If I could find one to believe in.

Would our hearts still bloody beat  
If the mountains crumble away  
And the river dry  
Would it stop the stepping feet

Nobody left to bury  
Nobody left to dig the holes

You can't have it all  
All by yourself  
Something's always missing  
'Til you share it with someone else  
There's a difference in living and living well  
  
My days are brighter  
My sky a deeper blue  
My nights are sweeter  
When I'm with you  
  
There's a difference in  
Living and living well  
You can't have it all  
All by yourself  
Something's always missing  
'Til you share it with someone else  
There's a difference in living and living well

I should go out tonight  
And get on with my life  
Break these chains of solitude  
A little luck and a little help  
I might even find myself  
In the arms of someone new  
  
But, once you've loved somebody  
It ain't that easy to do  
Once you've somebody  
Like I've loved you  
  
Look what you've gone and done  
You've ruined it for anyone  
Who tries to steal this heart away  
I can't get you off my mind  
I've told myself a million times  
A little time is all it takes  
  
But, once you've loved somebody  
It ain't that easy to do  
Once you've somebody  
Like I've loved you  
  
I gave you everything that I had to give  
I don't know if I can go that far again  
  
But, once you've loved somebody

Once you've somebody  
Like I've loved you

Oh, like I've loved you

Maybe I don't like it, but I have no choice

How could it end this way?

"727","Iron Maiden","Fear Of The Dark","I am a man who walks alone  
And when I'm walking a dark road  
At night or strolling through the park  
  
When the light begins to fade  
I sometimes feel a little strange  
A little anxious when it's dark  
  
Fear of the dark, fear of the dark  
I have constant fear that something's  
Always near  
Fear of the dark, fear of the dark  
I have a phobia that someone's  
Always there  
  
Have you run your fingers down  
The wall  
And have you felt your neck skin crawl  
When you're searching for the light?  
Sometimes when you're scared  
To take a look  
At the corner of the room  
You've sensed that something's  
Watching you  
  
Have you ever been alone at night  
Thought you heard footsteps behind  
And turned around and no one's there?  
And as you quicken up your pace  
You find it hard to look again  
Because you're sure there's  
Someone there  
  
Watching horror films the night before  
Debating witches and folklore's  
The unknown troubles on your mind  
Maybe your mind is playing tricks  
You sense, and suddenly eyes fix  
On dancing shadows from behind  
  
Fear of the dark, fear of the dark  
I have a constant fear that something's  
Always near  
Fear of the dark, fear of the dark  
I have a phobia that someone's  
Always there  
  
When I'm walking a dark road  
I am a man who walks alone

So that I can keep comin' around  
How messed up would that be?  
So I'm chillin'  
But I must admit, I'm kind of mad  
Ain't every day you find one like that  
Beautiful body with a brain to match  
Make a fella start feeling attached

Single and happy, that's where I'm at  
And she wasn't ever approving of that  
She wanted me to give her more  
But I told her though, ain't long ago  
A relationship, I wasn't lookin' for  
In and out of town and always on the road  
But when I hit that city I called her though  
And that's wrong, so wrong  
She waited for me to come around so long, so long  
And now that wifey material is wifey material  
And if you ain't ready, the wife gotta let it go  
I wasn't, he was though  
So...

So I got to let him, have her, like it or not  
Like she deserves  
Like she deserves

Of all the trades a going, begging is the best  
When a man gets tired he can sit down and rest  
Singin' for his supper when there's nothing else to do  
When I come around the corner with me old rigadoo  
  
I went to a barn, went down to Currabawn  
Got down on the floor and I slept till the dawn  
Holes in the roof and the rain seeping thru  
Me toes froze together in me little beggar shoes  
  
Buy a pair of leggings and a collar and a tie  
A nice old lady you will find by and by  
Buy a pair of leggings and I'll color them blue  
For a foxy old lady I'll make her too  
  
I met a little flaxen haired girl one day  
Good morning little flaxen haired girl, I did say  
Good morning little beggarman how do you do  
With your bags and your rags and your auld rigadoo  
  
Who should I waken but the woman of the house  
With her white spotted apron and her calico blouse  
She began to frighten so I said boo  
Sure, don't be afraid, it's only Johnny Dhu  
  
Over the road with me pack on me back  
Over all the fields with me big heavy sack  
Over the hills with the moon peeking through  
Singing, skin a ma rink a doodle on me auld rigadoo  
  
I must be going to bed, it's getting late at night  
The fire is all out, so out goes the light  
Now you've heard the story of the auld rigadoo  
So good night and God be with you, this is auld Johnny Dhu

But history shows that kindoms fall with time  
Mistrust and deceit and the bottle it brought defeat

In the meadow we can build a snowman  
And pretend that he is Parson Brown

Down to western Kentucky where my parents were born  
And there's a backwards old town that's often remembered  
So many times that my memories are worn

Well sometimes we'd travel right down the Green River  
To the abandoned old prison down by Adrie Hill  
Where the air smelled like snakes and we'd shoot with our pistols  
But empty pop bottles was all we would kill

And they tortured the timber and stripped all the land

Then they wrote it all down as the progress of man

Darkness all around my heart.  
I was alone but didn't fear  
To wander in the light of stars.  
  
In the bright and silent night,  
Winds would knock and disappear.  
Still I felt the feeling near,  
Like the first time you were ever here.  
  
You're so far away,  
So far away,  
You left me,  
You told me you would stay.  
  
You never said goodbye  
And I'll keep asking why,  
I keep on asking how,  
Oh come unto me now.  
  
I have breathed the morning air,  
I have heard the four winds blow.  
I was weary but prepared to follow  
Down this lonely road.  
  
In the room where lovers sleep,  
Winds would knock and disappear.  
Still I felt the music near,  
Like the first time we were ever here.  
  
You're so far away,  
So far away,  
You left me,  
You told me you would stay.  
  
You never said goodbye  
And I keep wondering why,  
I keep on wondering how,  
Oh come inside me now.

Need you tonight, lover don't fade away  
I've seen your city lights  
As I walk away  
Why can't this night...go on forever  
  
Without love, we won't survive  
Run together, we rule the night  
Tell me secrets, oh that make you cry  
Where's the laughter, we gotta try

With everything to gain I end up losing it all  
When the darkness gets in  
I scream out and your light sets me free

And I wish that I could give you something in return  
For the precious time you wasted on the tears I've never earned  
For reaching out to help me 'cross the bridges that I burned  
  
And in the end you'll finally see  
That, baby, I've done everything I possibly can  
I do it again 'cause know you're everything that I need  
  
I'm not afraid of the the truth no more  
I'm not afraid of the lies I hid  
I'm not afraid of the past of my sins  
'Cause I paid for the wrongs I did  
  
I'm not afraid of the things you know  
I'm just a book for the world to read  
My final words on the final page  
Will be amends 'cause I believe  
  
Your love is blind, blind as a bat  
The way that you're leading me home like that  
Your love is blind, blind as bat  
  
Your heart is kind, mine's painted black  
The way me forgive me and just take me back  
Your love is blind, blind as bat

Show me something I can trust  
You stole my heart on the night we met  
But I'm not ready to follow it yet  
So whatever you do, don't say that  
Don't say that  
Just hold me and show me you love me  
That says it all  
These moments of tenderness  
Mean so much more  
And we'll get there eventually  
So please be patient with me  
And don't say that --not now, not here  
I just want to feel your touch  
Don't say that to soothe my fear  
Show me something I can trust  
You stole my heart on the night we met  
But I'm not ready to follow it yet  
So whatever you do, don't say that  
Don't say, ""We'll last forever""  
""We'll always be together""  
Just lay here silently next to me and don't say that  
Don't say that, no  
Don't say that --not now, not here  
I just want to feel your touch  
And don't say that to soothe our fear  
Show me something I can trust  
You stole my heart on the night we met  
And I'm not ready to follow it yet  
So whatever you do  
Your kisses are all of the proof I need, yeah  
So whatever you do, don't say that  
Don't say that, oh, don't say that  
Don't speak, don't talk  
Just hold me honey  
You don't have to use words  
Just hold me honey  
No need to speak  
No, no, no, no don't use words

"767","ABBA","Cassandra","Down in the street they're all singing and shouting  
Staying alive though the city is dead  
Hiding their shame behind hollow laughter  
While you are crying alone on your bed  
  
Pity Cassandra that no one believed you  
But then again you were lost from the start  
Now we must suffer and sell our secrets  
Bargain, playing smart, aching in our hearts  
  
Sorry Cassandra I misunderstood  
Now the last day is dawning  
Some of us wanted but none of us would  
Listen to words of warning  
But on the darkest of nights  
Nobody knew how to fight  
And we were caught in our sleep  
Sorry Cassandra I didn't believe  
You really had the power  
I only saw it as dreams you would weave  
Until the final hour  
  
So in the morning your ship will be sailing  
Now that your father and sister are gone  
There is no reason for you to linger  
You're grieving deeply but still moving on  
  
You know the future is casting a shadow  
No one else sees it but you know your fate  
Packing your bags, being slow and thorough  
Knowing, though you're late, that ship is sure to wait  
  
Sorry Cassandra I misunderstood  
Now the last day is dawning  
Some of us wanted but none of us would  
Listen to words of warning  
But on the darkest of nights  
Nobody knew how to fight  
And we were caught in our sleep  
Sorry Cassandra I didn't believe  
You really had the power  
I only saw it as dreams you would weave  
Until the final hour  
  
I watched the ship leaving harbor at sunrise  
Sails almost slack in the cool morning rain  
She stood on deck, just a tiny figure  
Rigid and restrained, blue eyes filled with pain  
  
Sorry Cassandra I misunderstood  
Now the last day is dawning  
Some of us wanted but none of us would  
Listen to words of warning  
But on the darkest of nights  
Nobody knew how to fight  
And we were caught in our sleep  
Sorry Cassandra I didn't believe  
You really had the power  
I only saw it as dreams you would weave  
Until the final hour  
  
I'm sorry Cassandra  
I'm sorry Cassandra

Exactly everything I've always wanted  
But I can't believe she gives it all to me  
Mmm, lips that warm my face with mornin' kisses  
Arms that reach to hold me tenderly  
And love that always satisfies completely  
But I can't believe she gives it all to me

Somehow she knows I need her desperately

When I put the broom away I see the dress that Alice wore  
It's hanging in the closet sadly sagging without form  
Empty dress there in the closet held a body soft and warm  
Shoes and dress that Alice wore  
It's the dress she wore the night she caught me lying there beside  
Some strange woman meaning nothing just some bones and hair and hide  
I could pot explain it to her and I cannot to this day  
Now I stand here staring at the dress she wore to go away  
Shoes and dress that Alice wore  
And the shoes are red and shiny and they're modest in the heel  
And the dress a bad investment and the color could be teal  
She went screaming from the room where I lay blinking in the nude  
With the woman there beside me saying ain't this woman rude  
Shoes and dress that Alice wore  
So, I asked the undertaker in a private kind of way  
Before you close the casket when our friends have gone away  
If it's not too strange to reason I would make one last request  
Since it all goes in the ground I'd like to have the shoes and dress  
Shoes and dress that Alice wore  
So, I'm humming as I walk this house

A woman lay and cries  
At the sister of Mercy  
On a Sabbath day  
Night a nine of diamonds  
As revelers commence  
To shiver as she bore  
In a babe, a radiance  
  
Brave in constant motion  
Wherein perfection brews  
Darkness as his brother  
Mischief as his moon  
Summoning beneath  
With his gypsy moves  
Yearning as the foal  
Shy and beautiful  
  
Every card he drew  
Had a different face  
Lingering and lost  
Unholy holy ghosts  
I tend to play them all  
He spoke with confidence  
Another kind of strange  
To shift in loneliness  
  
He sought not for himself  
The empire he would find  
Save the golden womb  
He enter in his mind  
  
We will die a littler  
The rogues whistling  
Nine blue-eyed sailors  
Tip their caps to him  
As he passes through them  
More vagabond than king  
With diamonds on his sleeves  
Like a harlequin

"783","Dream Theater","Surrounded","Morning comes too early ,  
And night time falls too late.  
And sometimes all I want to do is wait.  
The shadow I've been hiding in  
Has fled from me today.  
  
I know it's easier  
To walk away,  
Than look it in the eye.  
But I will raise a shelter to the sky  
And here beneath this star tonight I'll lie  
She will slowly yield the light  
As I awaken from the longest night.  
  
Dreams are shaking set sirens waking up tired eyes  
With the light the memories all rush into his head.  
By a candle stands a mirror of his heart and soul she dances  
She was dancing through the night above his bed.  
And walking to the window  
  
He throws the shutters out against the wall  
And from an ivory tower hears her call  
""Let light surround you""  
  
It's been a long, long time  
He's had a while to think it over  
In the end he only sees the change  
Light to dark  
Dark to light  
Light to dark  
Dark to light  
  
Heaven must be more than this  
When angels waken with a kiss  
Sacred hearts won't take the pain  
But mine will never be the same  
He stands before the window  
His shadow slowly fading from the wall  
And from an ivory tower he hears her call  
""Let the light surround you""  
  
Once I was but I was found.  
When I heard the stained glass  
Shatter all around me.  
She whispers words to clear my mind.  
I once could see but now at last,  
I'm blind.  
  
I know it's easier  
To walk away,  
Than look it in the eye.  
But I have given all that I could take.  
And now I've only habits left to break.  
Tonight I'll still be lying here surrounded  
In all the light.

And so you turn your back on me  
And all the hot air that only echoes stale tobacco  
  
Actions speak louder now than words  
By just a fraction  
What's the use of saying I love you whe I'm drinking to distraction  
We save our sanity  
By saying such and such  
After all its been discussed  
You say you must be touched

Shouting out loud

After the years of waiting  
I'm gonna show them all  
  
I can see the world in a different light  
Now it's easy to say  
Where I went wrong  
What I did right  
  
I can hear the beat of a different drum  
Take it all in my stride  
Hold my head high  
Second to none  
  
Holding on wasn't always easy  
Nothing can change my mind

Limelight shining on me telling the world who I am

Maybe the role's not easy, maybe the prize is small  
After all the years of waiting, I'm gonna show them all

To tell you that I love you

It could have been me if I wanted to  
But it wasn't

It's a terrible day.  
Up with the lark, silly girl i don't know what to say,  
She was running away.  
But now I'm standing on the corner,  
Lost in the things that i said.  
What am i supposed to do now?  
  
Goodbye blackberry way  
I can't see you, i don't need you.  
Goodbye blackberry way  
Sure to want me back another day.  
  
Flowers in the park overgrowing but the trees are bare  
There's a memory there.  
Boats on the lake, unattended now for all to drown  
I'm incredibly down.  
Just like myself they are neglected,  
Turn with my eyes to the wall  
What am i supposed to do now?  
  
Goodbye blackberry way  
I can't see you, i don't need you.  
Goodbye blackberry way  
Sure to want me back another day.  
  
Run for the train, look behind you for she may be there  
Said a thing in the air  
Blackberry way, see the battlefield of careless sins  
Cast to the winds  
So full of emptiness without her,  
Lost in the words that i said.  
What am i supposed to do now?  
  
Goodbye blackberry way  
I can't see you, i don't need you.  
Goodbye blackberry way  
Sure to want me back another day.

You save your pennies and you buy another day  
But after all it's only hide and seek, just another game

Car crash low light  
Can't wear my mask your first my last

Two birds is what they'll see  
Getting lost upon their way

Silent on the bed  
This was their celebration  
She had her eyes closed  
Nothing was said  
They had fulfilled temptation  
He looked through the curtains  
He looked at the phone  
He couldn't be certain if this was his home  
Satisfied that this was it  
A rhythmic breath and a gentle grip  
Satisfied and they were sure  
They couldn't fulfill each other more  
  
They stroked each other  
He played with her hair  
Deep in a warm sedation  
The legs of his jeans  
Hung over the chair  
Love was their meditation  
She looked at his shoulders  
She looked at his eyes  
The look there told her he was satisfied  
  
They laid there apart  
In another world  
Deep in a warm sedation  
As love turned to sleep  
Their bodies curled  
Into sweet inspiration  
They looked at each other  
They looked at the night  
Under the covers they were satisfied

"797","Marillion","The Last Straw","(fish, steve rothery, mark kelly, pete trewavas, ian mosley)  
  
Hotel hobbies padding dawns hollow corridors  
A typewriter cackles out a stream of memories  
  
Drying out a conscience, evicting a nightmare  
Opening the doors for the dreams to come home  
  
We live out lives in private shells  
Ignore our senses and fool ourselves  
To thinking that out there there's someone else cares  
Someone to answer all our prayers, all our prayers...  
  
Are we too far gone, are we so irresponsible  
Have we lost our balls, or do we just not care  
We're terminal cases that keep talking medicine  
Pretending the end isn't quite that near  
We make futile gestures, act to the cameras  
With our made up faces and pr smiles  
And when the angel comes down, down to deliver us  
We'll find out that after all, we're only men of straw  
  
But everything is still the same  
Passing the time passing the blame  
We carry on in the same old way  
We'll find out we left it too late one day to say what we meant to say  
  
Just when you thought it was safe to go back to the water  
Those problems seem to arise the ones you never really thought of  
The feeling you get is similar to something like drowning  
Out of your mind, you're out of your depth, you should have taken soundings  
Clutching at straws, we're clutching at straws, we're clutching at straws  
  
And if you ever come across us don't give us your sympathy  
You can buy us a drink and just shake our hands  
And you'll recognise by the reflection in our eyes that deep down inside we're
all one and the same  
  
We're clutching at straws  
We're still drowning  
Clutching at straws  
We're still drowning, yeah clutching at straws  
I'm still drowning  
We're clutching at straws  
I'm still drowning

"804","Megadeth","44 Minutes","It was a cool winter's morning  
Somewhere shortly past 9:00 AM  
The armored car they wanted to heist wasn't coming  
So instead they went for the bank  
  
The fateful duo that sat in the get-away car  
Heavily sedated with thousands of round  
Armor piercing, fully automatic weapons  
The bowls of wrath poured out on the ground  
  
[Chorus]  
Baptized in a firefight  
Hot blood running cold as ice  
Forty four minutes of target practice  
All hell's breaking loose  
Outgunned, watching ""The Force"" come to a firefight with a pocketknife  
Getting schooled until they shot Achilles' heel  
And brought down the beast!!!  
  
This was an accident waiting to happen  
It wasn't if it would happen, it was when  
The city's people sabotaged themselves  
Calling their firepower an unneeded expense  
  
The two most violent men it seemed couldn't be stopped  
Standard police issue guns were just not enough  
But SWAT arrived to settled the fight  
Between AK-47 and AR-15  
  
[Chorus: x2]

"806","Arlo Guthrie","Doors Of Heaven","Words and music by Arlo Guthrie  
If all the doors were closed in heaven  
Where would all the angels go  
Would they just fly around forever  
Or would they come down here below  
If the pearly gates were closed this morning  
Would there be angels here tonight  
And would they live their lives among us  
And share the darkness with their light  
If all the doors were close in heaven  
They'd have to close the road to hell  
We'd all be stuck here with each other  
There would be nowhere else to dwell  
If the pearly gates were closed this morning  
And everyone there had to leave  
And death was nothing but a moment  
Beyond the breaths you took to breathe  
If all the doors were closed in heaven  
Who would dare abuse a child  
Or let a little kid go hungry  
Or not return a simple smile  
If the pearly gates were closed this morning  
And the host of heaven was on the street  
I wonder if they'd look much different  
From the likes of you and me  
So I hope they close the doors to heaven  
And all the angels up above  
Come and build a home among us  
Remind us what it is to love  
If the pearly gates were closed this morning  
Would there be angels here tonight  
And would they live their lives among us  
And share the darkness with their light

Everything that was wrong  
For the things that were right

Now I know just what to do  
Once you said goodbye to me, yeah  
Now I say goodbye to you  
  
It's so hard to find your way  
When the lies come around  
Still it happens everyday  
So don't let it get you down  
  
Just a time within a time  
Just a scheme within a scheme  
A little world within a world  
Yes, a dream, just a dream  
  
Now I finally found my way  
Now I know just what to do  
Once you said goodbye to me, yeah  
Now I say goodbye to you

Before the night turns blue  
Once you said goodbye to me, yeah  
And now I say goodbye to you  
Once you said goodbye to me, yeah  
Now I say goodbye to you

"808","Gordon Lightfoot","On The High Seas","Was it someone she met that's so hard to forget  
Was it some kind of an ocean of changes  
I don't remember where she said she would be  
And since I don't know, let me guess  
Was it somewhere in Michigan or the Lake of the Woods  
Up in old Montreal or Toronto the good  
Somewhere in Reno or somewhere in Rome  
And when all is said and done  
Will she leave me alone  
  
I don't want to get so low  
And as for my sadness, it comes and it goes  
I don't remember where she said she would be  
Back in the city or on the high seas  
  
Was it up in Hornpayne where the trains run on time  
Was she drinking champagne when she made up her mind  
North of the border or down in South Bend  
And when all is said and done  
Is there no rainbow's end  
  
I don't want to own the key  
To some ghostly mansion where souls are set free  
I don't remember where she said she would go  
Straight for the highway or down the low road  
I don't remember where she said she would be  
Back in the city or on the high seas

One glance from your direction and the government will fall

Starring you him and me  
In love as in war all is fair  
So a fight to the finish begins  
When you fight from desire you fight fire with fire  
So may the best woman win

A mighty Indian tribe  
But the winds of change,  
Made them realize, that the promises were lies.  
  
The white man's greed, in search of gold  
Made the nation bleed  
They lost their faith  
And now they had to learn  
There was no place to return  
Nowhere they could turn.  
  
Cherokee - marching on the trail of tears.  
  
They were driven hard, across the plains  
And walked for many moons  
Cause the winds of change,  
Had made them realize, that the promises were lies.  
  
So much to bear, all that pain  
Left them in despair  
They lost their faith  
And now they had to learn  
There was no place to return  
Nowhere they could turn.

Instead I bought a 45 and set out 2 relieve her (Take him out)  
If he was taken out then he could never harm another  
No sooner than I got there, I was met by Cherry's mother cryin'  
  
Cherry, Cherry  
Every night I ask the Lord why? Oh why?  
Cherry, Cherry  
Another victim of a suicide (Why oh why?)  
Why?  
  
Cherry, Cherry  
I think about you every rising sun  
Whoa Cherry, Cherry  
Wherever you are, I hope U're havin' fun  
I hope U're having fun, baby  
  
Cherry, Cherry  
I'd give anything 2 kiss you  
Cherry, Cherry  
I guess I just miss you

"826","Journey","Lifetime Of Dreams","From the first day,  
I envisioned myself with you  
It's so hard to wait,  
But with you it was easy  
To do  
Somewhere in time  
I knew I would find you here with every  
Passing moment  
I see forever so clear  
Part of me was lost without you  
You are where I found my faith  
Feels like love is here to stay  
  
[Chorus]  
When I look in your eyes baby  
I see a lifetime of dreams come true  
And I want you to say, that you feel the same  
Way too  
The stars in your eyes tell me  
All my tomorrows will wait for you  
You're all of my prayers answered  
My one saving grace is you  
  
In another life, I believed that I loved you then,  
If lightning strikes twice, we are destined  
Together again  
We don't have to make a promise, we were  
Always meant to be  
It's written in the way you look at me, I see  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Love moves at the speed of light  
Takes years to get it right  
But we've got till the end of time  
I can see, I can see, You and me, forever  
You're the one woman that can make me stay  
My one and only saving grace  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I can see, I can see  
You and me, forever  
I can see, I can see  
You and me, forever

"827","Sting","The Secret Marriage","No earthly church has ever blessed our union  
No state has ever granted us permission  
No family bond has ever made us two  
No company has ever earned commission  
  
No debt was paid no dowry to be gained  
No treaty over border land or power  
No semblance of the world outside remained  
To stain the beauty of this nuptial hour  
  
The secret marriage vow is never spoken  
The secret marriage can never be broken  
  
No flowers on the altar  
No white veil in your hair  
No maiden dress to alter  
No Bible oath to swear  
  
The secret marriage vow is never spoken  
The secret marriage can never be broken

And your eyes mustn't glow like mine

But a few things can be tough

From the first moment I saw you I've treated you like a queen  
I've given you lots of presents  
Now listen to that, just look at that cat

Hey, something sexy bout her  
Girl on the floor, all her friends around her  
I mean real clean, ain't gotta touch or nothing  
It ain't like I like a chick on chick or something  
I'm just a sucker for a hot track  
Gimme a drink and a chick to tell 'Stop that'  
Dance is a hop and a clap, flip it round

Y'all be looking like, ""Ooh, he a movie star  
He ain't supposed to be out on the floor with everybody""  
But oh wait, whoa, y'all forgetting  
When I was, amateur spitting before the scripts were written  
First one in, last one out the club  
Bursting in, passing out in the club  
Back at it, this cat is the wit and the charm  
Taking you higher, like a syringe hittin' ya arm  
Bringing the fire, making your Benz ring the alarm  
Let me see you clap, spin baby, come on  
Switch  
  
Hey switch, turn it over and hit it  
Turn around, now switch  
Turn it over and hit it  
  
Oh, you just gonna stand there, huh  
What you too cute to dance, or you scared  
It ain't really that hard to do and  
I ain't trying to be in love with you and  
All I wanted was a moment or two to  
See if you could do that switch-a-roo and  
Shut your mouth fool, get your crew and  
The thick body and the rear one too and  
I'll be right hear waiting on you to  
See if y'all can do that switch-a-roo  
  
Hey, hey

A silhouette, a cigarette and a gesture of disdain  
I felt a dark door open, saw a sudden ghost come through  
A spark leap from my fingertip and I knew it must be you  
Ain't you the man who dies every day?  
You're the man who dies every day  
You're the man  
We never saw you walk in, we never saw you leave  
You flick the ashes off a lap on everybody's sleeve  
You always play that funny pack of cards without an ace  
And every street you ever walked is mapped out on your face  
'Cause you're the man who dies every day  
You're the man who dies every day  
You're the man  
You always kept a sunset behind your lonely shoulder  
You never showed on photographs and you never grew much older  
You flicker like a shaky shadow, moving like a thief  
You never drop your facade and you never seek relief  
'Cause you're the man who dies every day  
You're the man who dies every day  
You're the man who dies every day  
You're the man who dies every day

There is a river that runs from the mountains  
That one river is all rivers  
All rivers are that one  
  
There is a tree that stands in the forest  
That one tree is all forests  
All trees are that one  
  
There is a flower that blooms in the desert  
That one blossom is all flowers  
All flowers are that one  
  
There is a bird that sings in the jungle

It is the song of life  
It is the flower of faith  
It is the tree of temptation  
It is the river of no regret  
  
There is a child that cries in the ghetto  
That one child is all children  
All children are that one  
  
There is a vision that shines in the darkness  
That one vision is all of our dreams  
  
It is a vision of heaven  
It is a child of promise  
It is the song of life  
It is the river of no regret  
  
Let this be a voice for the mountains  
Let this be a voice for the river  
Let this be a voice for the forest  
Let this be a voice for the flowers  
Let this be a voice for the ocean  
Let this be a voice for the desert  
Let this be a voice for the children  
Let this be a voice for the dreamers  
Let this be a voice of no regret

Doesn't matter 'cause he's all alone.

Curses his body 'cause it's old and it gives no transportation.  
He sits in his one room shack alone but it provides no consolation.

His way.  
  
As long as he needs me...  
I know where I must be.  
I'll cling on steadfastly...  
As long as he needs me.  
  
As long as life is long...  
I'll love him right or wrong,  
And somehow, I'll be strong...  
As long as he needs me.  
  
If you are lonely  
Then you will know...  
  
When someone needs you,  
You love them so.  
  
I won't betray his trust...  
Though people say I must.  
  
I've got to stay true, just  
As long as he needs me.

Stood in the face of grim death  
Screaming monsters bring me to deafness  
My dagger and swagger are useless in the face of the mirror  
When the mirror is made of my face

This is the house of death  
Where even angels die in arms of demons  
This is the house of death  
Where even angels die in arms of demons...

Hide your heart, in your gut (In Your Gut)  
But for what? When they're waiting to pull you apart like a scarecrow  
On death row, soon now all of your secrets are shown

This is the house of death  
Where even angels die in arms of demons  
This is the house of death  
Even angels die in arms of demons...

Dedication: They told me George Jones was full of whiskey and he couldn't sing
anymore. They said he was skinny and sickly looking and he was through. I told
'em he was one of my best friends and whiskey could never make Gorge Jones
quit singing. George was on the wagon when we done this song but he sings like
he wishes he had a drink.  
  
Last week he spent his whole pay check on whiskey  
  
I know friday night he'll do it all again  
  
Oh he'll drink till he falls down  
  
Then he'll order one more round  
  
And then go home with that bottle in his hand  
  
And the only thing I can hold on to  
  
Is this bottle in my hand  
  
I know I'll never have to share it  
  
With any other man  
  
I'm so glad you introduced us  
  
And I'll do the best I can  
  
To be faithful to this bottle in my hand  
  
She told george that changing diapers  
  
Could sure become A drag  
  
And to clean the house and cook for him  
  
Was not her kind of bag  
  
She said she needed someone  
  
Who would love and understand  
  
Then she left him with that bottle in his hand  
  
And the only thing I can hold on to  
  
Is this bottle in my hand  
  
I know I'll never have to share it  
  
With any other man  
  
I'm so glad you introduced us  
  
And I'll do the best I can

All exotic fish I find like Jason and the Argonauts  
  
There may be no golden fleece,  
But human riches I'll release.  
  
I have watched the manimals go by  
Buying shoes, buying sweets, buying knives.  
I have watched the manimals and cried  
Buying time, buying ends to other peoples lives.  
  
Jason and the Argonauts  
  
There may be no golden fleece,  
But human riches I'll release.

Through Your grace, my Lord  
Is my life redeemed from sin  
In Your death, my Lord  
Did my life begin again!  
  
I was empty, Lord  
Till Your presence filled my soul  
Without purpose, Lord

How can I express

Just remember that death is not the end  
Not the end, not the end  
Just remember that death is not the end  
  
When you're standing on the crossroad  
That you cannot comprehend  
Just remember that death is not the end  
  
And all your dreams have vanished  
And you don't know what's up the bend  
Just remember that death is not the end  
Not the end, not the end  
Just remember that death is not the end  
  
When the storm clouds gather round you  
And heavy rains descend  
Just remember that death is not the end  
  
And there is no-one there to comfort you  
With a helping hand to lend  
Just remember that death is not the end  
Not the end, not the end  
Just remember that death is not the end  
  
For the tree of life is growing  
Where the spirit never dies  
And the bright light of salvation  
Up in dark and empty skies  
Where the cities are on fire  
With the burning flesh of men  
Just remember that death is not the end  
  
And you search in vain to find  
Some law-abiding citizen  
Just remember that death is not the end  
  
Not the end, not the end  
Just remember that death is not the end  
Not the end, not the end  
Just remember that death is not the end

Make him love her

Bright copper kettles and warm woolen mittens  
Brown paper packages tied up with strings

Cream colored ponies and crisp apple streudels  
Doorbells and sleigh bells and schnitzel with noodles  
Wild geese that fly with the moon on their wings  
These are a few of my favorite things  
  
Girls in white dresses with blue satin sashes  
Snowflakes that stay on my nose and eyelashes  
Silver white winters that melt into springs

When the bee stings  
When I'm feeling sad

Even if I ran away  
Your love never fails  
  
I know I still make mistakes  
But You have new mercies for me everyday  
Your love never fails  
  
You stay the same through the ages  
Your love never changes  
There maybe pain in the night  
But joy comes in the morning  
  
And when the oceans rage  
I don't have to be afraid  
Because I know that You love me  
Your love never fails  
  
The wind is strong and the water's deep  
But I'm not alone in these open seas  
'Cause Your love never fails  
  
The chasm is far too wide  
I never thought I'd reach the other side  
But Your love never fails  
You make all things work together for my good

Who you insist takes care of you under the covers  
And who is there for you and loves you like no other  
Then you kiss and tell me that you love me like a brother

I'd think that you were mine, you're with me all the time  
If I didn't know better

I'd think we were in love

Oh, oh, oh  
I could be wrong about the things you say  
But I don't rub up on my friends that way  
You tell me that you've always been a flirt  
But if it goes wrong, I could get hurt  
But no, you insist it's harmless playin'  
It's just a part of who you are, that it's just your nature  
And that it's fine  
You know I'm a friend, it's really nothing  
You say that I'm just like a  
That I'm just like a brother

My idea of a friend is when you  
Do a lotta things together and have a lotta fun  
But my definition of love is different

And you only want to be alone clinging to each other  
Like you and he should be, but like you and I are  
Well, I know it sounds crazy but

Stopped pushing fast food  
Been a multiple shooting  
Downtown at the bank  
Reluctantly the panic begins  
To catch fire  
But it did not affect  
The steady sale of jun  
The state office looked  
It looked like Hollywood  
With make-up bleeding all over the cracks  
Wo he blew his lines  
Facing the cameras  
He suffered the first

All live heart attack  
Oh you've caught an even atom tan  
  
The motor-cyanide  
Cyanide suicide  
He finally found the brick wall in his life  
Shining up his engine  
He dressed right up for it  
At the top of the speedo  
He crumpled the bike  
There's plenty people runnin' runnin' for cover-  
Hoping at best to hold off all the rest  
Once last stand at the bunker fire  
Machine gun and pitchfork and breast

But it isn't so easy  
So easy for lovers  
Chained in love  
Stained at the top of the tower  
The pink hearse is leaving at funeral speed  
Driving your heart  
Away with the flowers  
All night I waited  
I waited for a horseman  
His ever faithful  
His Indian friend  
I'm not the only one  
Of the caped crusader fan club watching the sky  
For mankind's friend

You'd probably walk around the block like a little kid.  
But kids don't know They can only guess  
How hard it is To wish you happiness  
  
I guess that love Is like a Christmas card  
You decorate a tree You throw it in the yard  
It decays and dies And the snowmen melt  
Well I once knew love I knew how love felt  
Yeah I knew love Love knew me  
And when I walked Love walked with me  
And I got no hate And I got no pride  
Well I got so much love That I cannot hide  
  
Say you drive a Chevy Say you drive a Ford  
You say you drive around the town till you just get bored  
Then you change your mind For something else to do  
And your heart gets bored with your mind and it changes you  
Well it's a doggone shame And it's an awful mess  
I wish you love I wish you happiness  
I wish you love I wish you happiness  
I guess I wish you All the best

No one to love me  
Only the wind in the long green grass  
The frost in a broken tree  
I was made to love magic  
All its wonder to know  
But you all lost that magic  
Many, many years ago  
I was born to use my eyes  
Dream with the sun and the skies  
To float away in a lifelong song  
In the mist where melody flies  
I was made to love magic  
I was born to sail away  
Into a land of forever  
Not to be tied to an old stone grave  
In your land of never  
I was made to love magic

Our drifting lives are bound  
  
To a falling crescent noon  
  
  
Feather clouds cry  
  
A vale of tears to earth  
  
Morning breaks and  
  
No one sees the quiet mountain birth  
  
Dressed in a brand new day  
  
The sun is on its way  
  
To a falling crescent noon  
  
  
Somewhere in  
  
A fairytale forest lies one  
  
Answer that is waiting to be heard  
  
  
  
You and I were  
  
Born like the breaking day  
  
All our seasons  
  
All our green Septembers  
  
Burn away

A sea of midnight blue

A cage that's been handed down the line  
Lost and running 'neath a million dead stars

The only constant, I am sure of.  
Is this accelerating rate of change.  
  
Downside up, upside down.  
Take my weight off the ground.  
Falling deep in the sky.  
Slipping in the unknown.  
  
I stand here, watch you spinning.  
Until I am drawn in.  
A centripetal force.  
You pull me in.  
  
Pull me in.  
  
OVO  
  
Downside up, upside down.  
Take my weight off the ground.  
Falling deep in the sky.  
Slipping in the unknown.

Acting like fools  
  
Tried to fly and climbed too high  
We saw it all, we had to fall  
But I swear it's true, was all for you

Making love all the time,  
Never let the day go by, or a night

You always found the spark to light my light

In the playboy books,  
Ain't got nothing on you  
In the way that you look  
But, an eye for an eye  
A tooth for a tooth  
When you get home  
You better give me some truth  
  
Tell me no lies  
When I ask you the questions,  
Tell the truth  
Your lies ain't gonna make it no more  
Tell me no lies,  
Baby you're no exception to the rule,  
Because I've heard it all before  
And babe believe me I never forget

"908","Owl City","The Saltwater Room","I opened my eyes last night  
And saw you in the low light  
Walking down by the bay  
On the shore,  
Staring up at the stars, that aren't there anymore  
I was feeling the night grow old  
And you were looking so cold  
So like an introvert  
I drew my over shirt  
Around my arms and began, to shiver violently before  
You happened to look  
And see the tunnels all around me  
Running into the dark  
Underground  
All the subways around, create a great sound  
To my motion fatigue  
Farewell  
With your ear to a seashell  
You can hear the waves in underwater caves  
As if you actually were inside a saltwater room  
  
Time together isn't never quite enough  
When you and I are alone, I've never felt so at home  
What will it take to make or break this hint of love?  
Only time, only time  
  
Can you believe that the crew has gone  
And wouldn't let me sign on?  
All my islands have sunk  
In the deep,  
And I can hardly relax or even oversleep  
But I feel more with your hand  
In mine  
When we walk on the shore line  
I guess we'll never know, why sparrows love the snow  
We'll turn off all of the lights and set this ballroom aglow  
  
So tell me darling do you wish we'd fall in love?  
(Yeah all the time) all the time  
Time together isn't never quite enough  
When you and I are alone, I've never felt so at home  
What will it take to make or break this hint of love?  
Only time, only time  
When we're apart whatever are you thinking of?  
If this is what I call home, why does it feel so alone?  
So tell me darling, do you wish we'd fall in love?  
All the time, all the time  
  
Time together isn't never quite enough  
When we're apart whatever are you thinking of?  
What will it take to make or break this hint of love?  
So tell me darling do you wish we'd fall in love?  
All the time,

"909","John Denver","Goodbye Again","It's five o'clock this morning, and the sun is on the rise  
There's frosting on the window pane, and sorrow in your eyes  
The stars are fading quietly, the night is nearly gone  
And so you turn away from me, and tears begin to come  
  
And it's goodbye again, I'm sorry to be leavin' you  
Goodbye again, as if you didn't know  
It's goodbye again, and I wish you could tell me  
Why do we always fight when I have to leave  
  
It seems a shame to leave you now, the days are soft and warm  
I long to lay me down again, to hold you in my arms  
I long to kiss the tears away, give you back the smile  
Other voices beckon me, to go a little while  
  
And it's goodbye again, I'm sorry to be leavin' you  
Goodbye again, as if you didn't know  
It's goodbye again, and I wish you could tell me  
Why do we always fight when I have to leave  
  
Have to go and see some friends of mine, some that I don't know  
Some who aren't familiar with my name,  
It's something that's inside of me not hard to understand  
It's anyone who listens to me sing  
  
And if your hours are empty now, who am I to blame  
You think if I were always here, our love would be the same  
As it is the time we have, is worth the time alone  
And lying by your side, the greatest peace I've ever known  
  
But it's goodbye again, I'm sorry to be leavin' you  
Goodbye again, as if you didn't know  
It's goodbye again, and I wish you could tell me  
Why do we always fight when I have to leave

Oh eyes to the ceiling and pants on the floor,  
I did the first thing wrong

The boys on the corner looked ready to fight  
I stuck my neck out and I looked at his face  
I left her standing, I was caught in a chase

She says ""how you doin ? "" and I say ""I'm not sure""

Forgotten, you've forgotten  
How to live beneath the sun

That you would always need me too  
I never thought someday, that I'd be telling you  
You've forgotten, you've forgotten  
The things you used to feel  
Forgotten, you've forgotten  
How to smile for real  
How to smile for real  
  
And for the changes you have made  
Your beauty was the price you paid  
All your dreams rose up and then you watched them fade.  
You've forgotten, you've forgotten  
You've forgotten, you've forgotten

"924","Howard Jones","Law Of The Jungle","Law of the jungle only the fit survive.  
Better make your life your own, do the survival jive.  
There are no answers, words are Cul-de-sac  
And the pity with actions... Difficult turning back  
  
Don't give a thought about those lucky dice  
Paranoid thoughts of worldly vice  
The big thumb it never rests on you  
Anything you want lies here for you...  
Takes a bit of time, means a bit of work  
Heart will give the sign it'll make me look.  
  
Ain't got a clue why I'm here at all  
So while I'm here I'm gonna have it all  
Science men won't explain a thing  
In this prison my soul must sing.  
  
Don't give a thought about those lucky dice

[Interlude]  
That night I said I was recording late  
I wasn't recording late  
I was just smokin' chillin' had a couple dranks  
Not much of anything  
That time I flew down to MIA  
Damn I went MIA  
I hit up KOD with a few bands to play  
And that ain't everything  
All I think about is bitches  
And everywhere I go they comin'  
Double standards that everybody talkin' bout  
The tables turned around I be throwin' up  
So I ain't tryna' justify

"926","Utopia","Love Is The Answer","Name your price  
A ticket to paradise  
I can't stay here any more  
And I've looked high and low  
I've been from shore to shore to shore  
If there's a short cut I'd have found it  
But there's no easy way around it  
  
Light of the world, shine on me  
Love is the answer  
Shine on us all, set us free  
Love is the answer  
  
Who knows why  
Someday we all must die  
We're all homeless boys and girls  
And we are never heard  
It's such a lonely world  
People turn their heads and walk on by  
Tell me, is it worth just another try?  
  
Tell me, are we alive, or just a dying planet?  
What are the chances?  
Ask the man in your heart for the answers  
  
And when you feel afraid, love one another  
When you've lost your way, love one another  
When you're all alone, love one another  
When you're far from home, love one another  
When you're down and out, love one another  
All your hope's run out, love one another  
When you need a friend, love one another  
When you're near the end, love one another  
We got to love one another  
  
Light of the world, you got to shine  
Love will be a means, yeah, yeah  
Shine on us all  
Know that love can save the day  
Just give it one more chance  
Lord you just can't let it stop lord  
Love is the answer  
Got to be free to let love into your life  
Let it shine

"927","Lou Reed","Open House","Please  
Come over to 81st street I'm in the apartment  
Above the bar  
You know you can't miss it, it's across from the subway  
And the tacky store with the mylar scarves  
My skin's as pale as outdoors moon  
My hair's silver like a Tiffany watch  
I like lots of people around me but don't kiss hello  
And please don't touch  
  
It's a Czechoslovakian custom my mother passed on to me  
The way to make friends Andy is invite them up for tea  
Open house  
Open house  
  
I've got a lot of cats, here's my favorite  
She's lady called Sam  
I made a paper doll of her, you can have it  
That's what I did when I had St. Vitus dance  
  
It's a Czechoslovakian custom my mother passed on to me  
Give people little presents so they remember me  
Open house  
Open house  
  
Someone bring the vegetables  
Someone please bring heat  
My mother showed up yesterday  
We need something to eat  
  
I think I got a job today they want me to draw shoes  
The ones I drew were old and used  
They told me to draw something new  
Open house  
Open house  
  
Fly me to the moon  
Fly me to a star  
But there are no stars in the New York sky  
They're all on the ground  
  
You scared yourself with music, I scared myself with paint  
I drew 550 different shoes today, it almost made me faint  
Open house  
Open house  
Open house

Clinging to the word that burns deep inside  
Eyes fixed on Your Name and endless light

"929","George Harrison","Pisces Fish","Rowers gliding on the river  
Canadian geese crap along the bank  
Back wheel of my bike begins to quiver  
The chain is wrapped around the crank  
  
Old ladies, who must be doggie training  
Walking, throwing balls, chasing all the sheep  
While the farmer stands around, and he's complaining  
His mad cows are being put to sleep and I'm a Pisces fish and the river runs
through my soul  
  
Smoke signals from the brewery  
Like someone in there found the latest Pope  
In a vat of beer that keeps pumping out with fury  
While the churchbell ringer's tangled in his rope  
  
There's a temple on an island  
I think of all the Gods and what they feel  
You can only find them in the deepest silence  
I got to get off of this big wheel  
  
And I'm a Pisces fish and the river runs through my soul  
I'm a Pisces fish and the river runs through my soul  
  
And I'll be swimming until I can find those waters  
That one unbounded ocean of bliss  
That's flowing through your parents, sons and daughters  
But still an easy thing for us to miss  
  
Blades go skimming through the water  
I hear the coxon shouting his instructions about  
With this crew oh it could be a tall order  
Have we time to sort all of these things out  
  
Some times my life it seems like fiction  
Some of the days it's really quite serene  
I'm living proof of all life's contradictions  
One half's going where the other half's just been  
And I'm a Pisces fish and the river runs through my soul

"931","Elvis Presley","Edge Of Reality","I walk along a thin line darling  
Dark shadows follow me  
Here's where life's dream lies disillusioned  
The edge of reality  
  
Oh I can hear strange voices echo  
Laughing with mockery  
The border line of doom I'm facing  
The edge of reality  
  
On the edge of reality she sits there tormenting me  
The girl with the nameless face  
On the edge of reality where she overpowers me  
With fears that I can't explain  
She drove me to the point of madness  
The brink of misery  
If she's not real then I'm condemned to  
The edge of reality  
  
On the edge of reality she sits there tormenting me  
The girl with the nameless face  
On the edge of reality where she overpowers me  
With fears that I can't explain

The brink of misery  
If she's not real then I'm condemned to  
The edge of reality

Reality, reality, reality, reality.

"932","Unearth","This Glorious Nightmare","Divine intoxication spills out the bores  
A self diluting fix that craves all the more  
Destructive seasoned vet,full glass of sting  
A bittersweet triumph that weighs in each day  
  
Obsession-my falsest friend  
Moderation-a fantasy that I cant win  
Devastation-a hardship loss  
Demanding-the pain of wasted years  
  
[Chorus]  
Lift me up,  
Tear me down,  
Will I last through this glorious nightmare  
  
Collapse all that sacred,prey on the weak  
Slow painful suicide that steals from each man  
Hells fire soon returns to rape the well  
Prolific doom machine that hears our words  
  
I'm fighting the will to live,  
With countless persuasions  
I'm fighting the will to live,  
The endless temptations,  
Its lifeless grip,  
That haunts us all  
  
Pulling from every direction,  
Its lifeless grip graps hold  
Yearning is now my dissension,  
Its lifeless grip graps hold

"933","Out Of Eden","Shoulda' Listened","Ohhh... Yeah  
I should have stopped, looked and listened before I proceeded  
But caution I threw to the wind  
Manyve been placed in my life to help lead me and guide me  
But I didn't want to talk to them  
So I ignored their advice and I tried to disguise pain from you and all the
things you did  
The wrong road was chosen my heart has been broken  
Cause I didn't want to hear them  
Shoulda said what I didn't say  
Shoulda went right but I went left that day  
Shoulda prayed but instead I strayed  
Shoulda gone a different way  
Shoulda listened to my mother  
When she said that you were no good for me  
Shoulda listened to my pastors  
When they told me turn around and leave you be  
Shoulda listened to my sisters  
When they said that I was too blind to see  
But I see the light somehow  
And I vow to listen now  
I had the chance to advance and it seemed like the best  
Opportunity that I could get  
I didn't bother to see if my people agreed  
Maybe I knew what they would say and yet  
I didn't control it I kept going for it  
When I shoulda known it wasn't in Gods plan  
Had to let go, had I listened before  
I wouldve said no from the door  
Shoulda said what I didn't say  
Shoulda went right but I went left that day  
Shoulda stayed but instead I strayed  
Shoulda gone a different way  
Shoulda listened to my mother  
When she said that you were no good for me  
Shoulda listened to my pastors  
When they told me turn around and leave you be  
Shoulda listened to my sisters  
When they said that I was too blind to see  
But I see the light somehow  
And I vow to listen now  
Shoulda listened to my mother  
When she said that you were no good for me  
Shoulda listened to my pastors  
When they told me turn around and leave you be  
Shoulda listened to my sisters  
When they said that I was too blind to see  
But I see the light somehow  
And I vow to listen now  
Shoulda listened I know I shoulda listened  
But I know that I vow to listen now  
Shoulda listened I know I shoulda listened  
But you don't have to tell me twice I'm going to listen now  
Shoulda listened if only I had listened  
But I've learned my lesson now  
I'm gonna listen now  
Shoulda listened cause I just can't be missing  
All the things God has for me  
Repeat till end

"934","ABBA","Head Over Heels","I have a very good friend  
The kind of girl who likes to follow a trend  
She has a personal style  
Some people love it others tend to go wild  
You hear her voice everywhere  
Taking the chair  
She's a leading lady  
And with no trace of hesitation she keeps going  
  
Head over heels  
Breaking her way  
Pushing through unknown jungles every day  
She's a girl with a taste for the world  
(The world is like a playing ground where she goes rushing)  
Head over heels  
Setting the pace  
Running the gauntlet in a whirl of lace  
She's extreme if you know what I mean  
  
Her man is one I admire  
He's so courageous but he's constantly tired  
Each time when he speaks his mind  
She pats his head and says that's all very fine  
Exert that will of your own  
When you're alone  
Now we better hurry  
And with no trace of hesitation she keeps going  
  
Head over heels  
Breaking her way  
Pushing through unknown jungles every day  
She's a girl with a taste for the world

Go into your sacred dance  
Say a prayer for our romance  
And make Wildflower mine

I did it, but the devil didn't make me  
I did it for the suckers who tried to shake and bake me  
Proving a point that I'm a serious joint  
You can roll me up and puff me, and then I'll anoint  
Your head with oil--lots of oil  
Make it run like water, watch it boil  
'Cause I made 'em play it, made 'em say it  
Made 'em okay it, made 'em obey it---huh!

I heard your new jam, I don't play that  
It ain't loud enough punk, it ain't hitting  
This year you tried, next year you're quitting  
Last year you thought I was dying out  
But again, and again, and again without a doubt  
It's the gangster boogie, the earthquake sound  
Pump it up and play it so they hear it all around  
I do it up rough, tough, I don't bluff  
And this is an example of funky stuff  
When you want to make hits, you make 'em like this  
They ain't like this they don't hit, they miss

Kidnap him and slap him up inside of a van

How that sound? Don't came around, playing me close, brown  
Pull on my jock to be down  
You need to stay down, way down, because you're low down  
Do that dance, the prince of rap is gonna throw down  
Aiming to please while I'm killing emcees

A killing machine, a savage street talker  
Jason with an axe, but I put it on wax

Kicking it mean, keeping it clean  
And you've never seen anybody rock the party

Moving my hand like I'm playing the piano  
Don't touch the dial, don't change the channel

"962","Mary Black","Almost Gone","As I'm leaving a change come on my eyes  
These streets persuading me with mumbled strange goodbyes  
Through the water through the ring - To the soul of everything  
Throw my heart out on the stones and I'm almost gone  
  
There's no meaning in clothes and coffee cups  
Cheap hotel furniture where silence never stops  
Through the water through the ring - To the sould of everything  
Cry my eyes out to the winds and I'm almost gone  
  
Almost gone  
And I'm dreaming just staring at the walls  
At cars all frozen now and street light waterfalls  
Through the water through the ring - To the soul of everything  
  
Throw my heart out on the stone and I'm almost gone  
Through the water through the ring - To the soul of everything  
Wash my heart out on the stones - and I'm almost gone  
Almost gone

And nights, those 2 AM calls  
Where dreams become walls  
And you just need a break  
Break on me

Take as long as it takes, girl

When your heart needs to break  
Just break on me

There'll be times when someone you know  
Becomes someone you knew  
But you'd do anything to change it  
And words you wanna take back  
But you know you can't  
When the page just won't turn  
And it still hurts  
Break on me

Shatter like glass  
Come apart in my hands  
Take as long as it takes, girl

When your heart needs to break  
Just break on me

When you need somebody right now  
You're where I'll be

I have to watch the road  
I swear that every car that passes has you in it  
I can't believe we're finished  
My life is movin' fast  
The time will often pass  
And something will remind me  
I can't put this behind me  
I thought you would've called by now, by now  
You could've had my all by now, by now  
It's been too many years for you to disappear  
And have me asking the question  
  
[Hook]  
I wonder whatever became of you  
Although, it's not that I'm surprised, it's not I didn't try  
It's not that I was frightened, of you  
Although, I said all goodbyes  
And, you had all your cries  
I wonder whatever became of you  
I wonder whatever became of you  
I wonder whatever became of you  
  
[Verse 2: dawn richard]  
I swear I heard you call  
But when I heard you'd gone  
I hate that I looked desperate  
You gone is like me naked  
I'm staring at your (?)  
Trying to make it last  
Keep looking close behind me  
My eyesight on a memory  
I thought you would've called by now, by now  
You could have all my love right now, by now  
Gave into my fears  
While you just disappeared  
That's why I'm asking this question...  
  
[Hook]  
I wonder whatever became of you  
Although, it's not that I'm surprised, it's not I didn't try  
It's not that I was frightened, of you

And, you had all your cries  
I wonder whatever became of you  
I wonder whatever became of you  
I wonder whatever became of you  
  
[Verse 3: drake]  
I can't go to bed  
Thinking about my goals  
And how we used to say a goal is just a dream with a deadline  
Where did the other half of my heart go?  
Why am I in bed alone?  
How come when I drive by, it looks like you are never home?  
Do you even live there?  
Or did you take a u-haul?  
Too far, move off and not even tell me that you're gone?  
We were on fire  
Somehow that fire cooled off, burnt out  
I kept straight, but I wonder how you turned out  
  
[Hook]  
I wonder whatever became of you  
Although, it's not that I'm surprised, it's not I didn't try  
It's not that I was frightened, of you  
Although, I said all goodbyes  
And, you had all your cries  
I wonder whatever became of you  
I wonder whatever became of you  
I wonder whatever became of you

Oh darling how I miss you  
I'm just the mere shadow of my former selfishness  
I crave the silhouette of your kiss  
With only the blue light of the tv on  
Lip reading threats and false alarms  
There's a boy somewhere holding hands with himself  
And a girl in a window on the Reeperbarn

Whenever I put my foot in my mouth and you begin to doubt  
That it's you that I'm dreaming about  
Do I have to draw you a diagram?  
All I ever want is just to fall into your human hands  
  
With the kings and queens of the dance hall craze  
Checkmate in three moves in your heyday  
But the girls don't listen to your line anymore  
Now you're part of someone else  
  
On the factory floor and you still say ""Wheres the action?""  
Now you manufacture happiness  
And get sold on the cheap for someone's satisfaction

All you toy soldiers and scaremongers  
Are you living in this world sometimes I wonder  
In between saying you've seen too much and saying you've seen it all before  
  
Tighter and tighter I hold you tightly  
You know I love you more than slightly  
Although I've never said it like this before

Carry me on my way, carry me on my way.  
  
I worry about my actions,  
I think about the damage I do.  
I've seen the coming attractions,  
Armageddon and Waterloo.  
I tried to change my mind,  
I wasted precious time.  
  
Carry me on my way, carry me on my way.  
Carry me on my way, carry me on my way.  
  
Who knows where the time goes,  
Only everything is everything.  
Feels like I'm wearing my father's clothes, Singing a song my brother would
sing.  
I turned to hide my face,  
They're gone without a trace.  
  
Carry me on my way, carry me on my way.  
Carry me on my way, carry me on my way.

"981","Waterboys","Love And Death","Behold the flashing waters  
A cloven dancing jet  
That from the milk-white marble  
For ever foam and fret  
Far off in drowsy valleys  
Where the meadow saffrons blow  
The feet of summer dabble  
In their coiling calm and slow  
The banks are worn forever  
By a people sadly gay  
A Titan with loud laughter  
Made them of fire clay  
Go ask the springing flowers  
And the flowing air above  
What are the twin-born waters  
And they'll answer Death and Love  
  
With wreaths of withered flowers  
Two lonely spirits wait  
With wreaths of withered flowers  
'Fore paradise's gate.  
They may not pass the portal  
Poor earth-enkindled pair  
Though sad is many a spirit  
To pass and leave them there  
Still staring at their flowers  
That dull and faded are  
If one should rise beside thee  
The other is not far  
Go ask the youngest angel  
She will say with bated breath  
By the door of Mary's garden  
Are the spirits Love and Death

Drove back to town this morning,  
With working on my mind  
I thought of maybe quittin',  
Thought of leavin' it behind  
  
Went back to bed this morning  
And as I'm pullin' down the blind,  
Yeah, the sky was dull and hypothetical  
And fallin' one cloud at a time

With its checkerboard floors  
Riding on horseback,  
And keeping order restored,  
Til The Men They Couldn't Hang,  
Stepped to the mic and sang,  
And their voices rang with that Aryan twang

Just a little after nine  
In the middle of that riot,  
Couldn't get you off my mind

One star at time

Out of this world to me

Parted like the red sea

Easy between the rocks and stones

The years  
Ended in confusion  
Don't ask me I don't know what happened  
But I am  
A man with a mission  
Must be the devil I don't know  
  
It's hard to let go  
Of all that we know  
As I walk away from you  
Hurled from my home  
Into the unknown  
As I walk away from you  
  
Reveal whatever you desire  
To you it may be death defying  
Black day  
In the coldness of winter  
Black words  
Slipping off my tongue  
I say forget it - it's over  
As a dark cloud covered up the sun  
  
It's hard to let go  
Of all that we know  
As I walk away from you  
The sun always sets  
With room for regrets  
As I walk away from you  
  
Give it to me  
Give it to me  
Your inspiration  
Give to receive  
Find all we need  
As I walk away  
  
Just a slave to ambition  
Tension your permanent condition  
So much you've always wanted  
Too much given' you a sore head

Nothing can please me only thoughts are of you  
You just laughed when I begged you to stay  
I've not stopped crying since you went away

Guess I will go home - sit down and moan.  
Crying and thinking is all that I do

"991","Alabama","Patches","(Spoken)  
I was born and raised down in Alabama  
On a farm way back up in the woods  
I was so ragged that folks used to call me Patches  
Papa used to tease me about it  
Of course deep down inside he was hurt  
'Cause he done all he could  
  
(Sang)  
Papa was a great old man  
I can see him with a shovel in his hand  
See, education he never had  
He did wonders when the time got bad  
The little money from the crops he raised  
Barely paid the bills he made  
So life had kicked him down to the ground  
When he tried to get up  
Life would kick him back down  
One day papa called me to his dyin bed  
Put his hands on my shoulders  
Then with a tears he said  
Patches, I'm depending on you son  
To pull the family through  
My son, it's all left up to you  
  
(Spoken)  
Two days later papa passed away  
And I became a man that day  
So I told mama I was gonna quit school  
She said that was daddy's strictest rule  
  
(Sang)  
So every morning 'fore I went to school  
I fed the chickens and I chopped wood too  
Sometimes I felt that I couldn't go on  
I wanted to leave just run away from home  
But I always remembered what my daddy said  
With tears in his eyes on his dyin bed  
He said, ""Patches, I'm depending on you son  
To pull the family through  
My son, it's all left up to you  
  
(Spoken)  
Then one day a strong rain came  
And washed all the crops away  
And at the age of thirteen I thought I was carrying  
The weight of the whole world on my shoulders  
But you know, mama she knew what I was going through,  
  
(Sang)  
Everyday I had to work the fields  
'Cause that's the only way we got our meals  
You see, I was the oldest of a family  
And everybody else depended on me  
Every night I heard my mama pray  
Lord, give him the strength to make another day  
Though years have passed and all the kids are grown  
And amgels took my mama to a brand new home  
Lord knows people that I she'd a tear  
My daddy's voice kept a-tinging in my ears  
Sayin, ""Patches, I'm depending on you son  
To pull the family through  
My son, it's all left up to you...  
  
Patches, I'm depending on you son  
I'm depending on you son  
To pull the family through  
My son, it's all left up to you...

Like your face I don't understand  
How you smile and pretend it's fun  
Do you laugh when the rats come round to play?

There was magic abroad in the air  
There were angels dining at the Ritz  
And a nightingale sang in Berkley Square  
  
I may be right, I may be wrong  
But I'm perfectly willing to swear  
That when you turned and smiled at me  
A nightingale sang in Berkley Square  
  
The moon that lingered over London town  
Poor puzzled moon, he wore a frown  
How could he know we two were so in love?  
The whole darn world seemed upside down  
  
The streets of town were paved with stars  
It was such a romantic affair  
And, as we kissed and said goodnight,  
A nightingale sang in Berkley Square

"994","Queen Latifah","The Pros","I stepped into a basement party in Brooklyn  
The brothers was looking as soon as I put a foot in  
A female walked up to me and said, ""Latifah bust a line""  
I don't think you're on the strength, show me the time  
  
I said, ""If you really want to do this we can do this fine'  
Take six paces and begin to rhyme""  
As soon as attempted to make a sound  
I ate her up with the verb broke her down with the noun  
  
'Cause I hate it when someone challenges with me but cannot balance with me  
I get annoyed when they can't go blow for blow  
I get pissed when I hear the lyrics a sucker brings  
  
Ha ha, I was thinking the same thing  
Well I was approached by a whole damn group of them  
Rhyme thieves, biters, and bums  
Took me kind of light, said they wanted to fight  
I kinda got uptight (You didn't do what I think you did?) Yeah, right!  
  
Bash! went the first, Smash! went the next one (What about the third?)  
He started, he started to run  
But to his surprise, his feet must have slipped  
Cause I snapped that neck before the second step  
  
You see you may speculate, but everybody knows  
Not one amateur can deal with the pros  
  
These are the pros, coming now from Queen Latifah and Daddy-O  
And if you want to hear more then just follow  
If you like the smooth chanted lyrics then just say ""Bo bo bo!""  
  
There was a time that a man could go  
Anyplace, anywhere without a Rambo  
But now me have to keep me pistol loaded with rhyme  
Have to deal with bad breath biters that step out of line  
  
So when they make a move them surely get a taste of it  
I'm Daddy-O and I don't quit  
So feel the flow, y'all because you're under attack  
From my rhymes, 'cause I'm writing swift rhymes in stacks  
  
And four words to the wack, just, ""Stay the hell back""  
Cause it's a fact, if you're wack you ain't saying jack  
So we can go rhyme for rhyme if you wish  
But eating you suckers is my favorite dish  
And I warned you suckers if you messed with me  
You'll be the next ingredient in my recipe  
  
Start and don't finish, I'll hunt you down  
And you can't run forever, so you'll be found  
And with nowhere to run, and nowhere to hide  
How you want to be eaten, boy, baked or fried?  
  
[Chorus: x 2]  
  
It's Latifah the Queen, pioneer of the mainstream  
I flow just like a pro cause it's the same thing  
Suckers have to realize how foolish they sound  
So button your lips and stop trying to be down  
  
I caught you out there (How many times?)  
A lot of times  
Cause when it comes to mine, you know I gotta rhyme  
Stepping to the right, to the left  
To the best place, well I have to face  
  
A sucker like a pooh-butt, weak and soft  
Riding my bra strap trying to get off  
Understand and know, if you want to go  
You'd better be ready to flow 'cause I'm a pro  
  
[Chorus: x 2]  
  
We wax floors with bums, make mocks out of some  
Sting 'em hard, and watch them complain how it stung  
Kidnap the babysitter, lock 'em inside a box  
Daddy-O and the true blue Queen of Rock

Cause you know I need you  
And there's no way I'll be leaving  
'Till we're kissing on the porch swing  
Oh my little sweet thing  
  
Oh c'mon sweet thing, sweet thing, sweet thing, sweet thing  
  
Yeah, c'mon now a little now  
Do do do do do do do do do do do  
Oh my little sweet thing, yes you are  
Do do do do do do do do do do do

"1000","Rush","High Water","When the waters rose  
In the darkness  
In the wake of the endless flood  
It flowed into our memory  
It flowed into our blood  
  
When something broke the surface  
Just to see the starry dome  
We still feel that relation  
When the water takes us home  
In the flying spray of the ocean  
The water takes you home  
  
Springing from the weight  
Of the mountains  
Like the heart of the earth  
Would burst  
Flowing out from marble fountains  
In the dreams of a desert thirst  
  
Something swam through  
The jungles  
Where the mighty rivers roam  
Something breaks the silence  
When the water takes you home  
I hear the wordless voices  
When the water takes me home  
  
Waves that crash on the shoreline  
Torrents of tropical rain  
Streaming down  
Beyond our memory  
Streaming down inside our veins  
  
When something left the ocean  
To crawl high above the foam  
We still feel that elation  
When the water takes us home  
In a driving rain of redemption  
The water takes me home...
